\textbf{Modern scientific discovery depends on collecting large heterogeneous datasets with many sources of variability, and applying domain-specific pipelines from which one can draw  insight or clinical utility. For example, macroscale connectomics studies require complex pipelines to process raw functional or diffusion data and estimate connectomes. Individual studies tend to customize pipelines to their needs, raising concerns about their reproducibility,  and adding to a longer list of factors that may differ across studies (including sampling, experimental design, and data acquisition protocols), resulting in failures to replicate. Mitigating these issues requires multi-study datasets and the development of pipelines that can be applied across them. We developed NeuroData's MRI to Graphs (\ndmg) pipeline using several functional and diffusion studies, including the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility, to estimate connectomes. Without any manual intervention or parameter tuning, \ndmg~ran on 25 different studies ($\approx$ 6,000 scans) from 15 sites,  with each scan resulting in a biologically plausible connectome (as assessed by multiple quality assurance metrics at each processing stage). For each study, the connectomes from \ndmg~are more similar within than across individuals, indicating that \ndmg~is preserving biological variability. Moreover, the connectomes exhibit near perfect consistency for certain connectional properties across every scan, individual, study, site, and modality; these include stronger ipsilateral than contralateral connections and stronger homotopic than heterotopic connections.

This open science approach provides us with an opportunity to understand and eventually mitigate spurious results for both past and future studies.

\section{Introduction}
% 
% Action: 
% 1. establish principles for pipelines
% 2. open source data including those with multiple measurements
% 3. open source pipeline adhering to principles applied to those data 
% 
% Reproducibility and replicability are fundamental to scientific progress.  
% When studies  replicate using new data or methods, the validity and utility  of inferences in both studies are strengthened.  
% Yet, many studies fail to replicate across disciplines~\cite{Ioannidis2005}, including numerous examples in neuroimaging~\cite{Button2013}. 
% 
%  Failures to replicate can have many causes, including variability in sampling, recruitment, experimental design, data acquisition details (e.g., phenotyping instruments, scanners, scan protocol parameters), quality control, data processing, data analysis, or statistical testing~\cite{Bennett2011-aw}, as well as unintended/ unknown sources of measurement error, underpowered samples, bad luck or poor research conduct practices~\cite{John2012, Loken2017}.
% The degree to which each of these factors cause problems impacts the efficacy of strategies to mitigate these problems in future studies.  There is therefore a need to develop computational and statistical pipelines that enable evaluating the impact of each of these potential factors. 
% 



Recent developments in technology enable experimentalists to collect increasingly large, complex, and heterogeneous data. 
Any single study can include both raw multi-modal data and
extensive metadata, 
including sample design, experimental protocols,  data acquisition, and subject specific demographics/phenotypics. Each of these variables adds different sources of variability, which can hamper our ability to interpret and/or generalize results~\cite{Kelly2012, Kaiser}.  Moreover, often only a subset of the potential sources of variability are documented or reported~\cite{Yan2013-vy}.  
Interpreting these data therefore requires deep data processing pipelines. Such pipelines are particularly important when attempting to enlarge sample size and increase power by aggregating data across multiple studies. These pipelines, however, can introduce additional sources of variability, if different pipelines are used on different datasets, or the same pipeline is applied across datasets but requires substantial tuning or manual intervention, or is run using different operating systems~\cite{Gronenschild2012-of}.
These sources of variability can collectively swamp the signal of interest, yielding studies with questionable reproducibility, scientific validity, and/or clinical utility. 

Studies in neuroimaging exemplify these properties. The data from a single study consist of structural, functional, and/or diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI, fMRI, and dMRI) scans, from multiple individuals. The metadata associated with a study includes the time, date, and location of the scans, the make and model of the scanner hardware and software, scanner acquisition protocols, as well as the demographic information from each individual, only some of which may be recorded and reported. A number of investigators have developed  processing pipelines for one or more of these modalities~\cite{cpac, Cui2013, Daducci2012, mrcap, migraine, Song2011, Yan2010, Yan2016, Wang2015, Calhoun2001-wc, Xu2015,Zuo2013}, but none of the pipelines are designed to address the  variability alluded to above, or work across both fMRI and dMRI.  


For example, a number of studies have identified frequently uncontrolled  variables that can radically alter the results of downstream inferences, such as menstrual cycle status~\cite{Yan2013-vy}.
Others have demonstrated that some statistics and normalization procedures result in stable parameter estimates across fMRI measurements \emph{within} an individual and study, but those analyses lacked a coherent statistical model, did not compare across studies, and did not consider dMRI data~\cite{Yan2013-vy}. 
A few investigations have pooled data across studies, with mixed results. With enough samples, certain properties are apparently preserved~\cite{Thompson2016-by,Abrol2017-fk}. Alternately, the use of sophisticated machine learning techniques can mitigate some of these issues~\cite{varoquaux2013learning}. Nonetheless, many studies continue to fail to be replicated~\cite{Button2013}. 





To rigorously identify and quantify the sources of variability both within and across  multi-modal neuroimaging  requires (1) data and (2) a pipeline. The requisite data includes  numerous datasets with multiple measurements per individual---including data that both conserve and vary a number of different factors. The requisite pipeline must be able to fully  process each sample and study, and analyze the results both within and across studies using a coherent statistical model.  


The Consortium of Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR) consists of about 30 different studies from nearly 20 different institutions around the world that provide the necessary data~\cite{corr}. But no existing pipeline can successfully estimate and meaningfully process every scan in this dataset---including both functional and diffusion data---while also quantifying the magnitude and source of variability amongst them. 
We, therefore, established several principles and metrics to guide the development of pipelines.  
We developed an approach, ``Neuro Data MRI to Graphs'' (\ndmg), that 
meets or exceeds standards along each of the above mentioned principles. We validated our pipeline by running \ndmg~on 11 dMRI  studies comprising 3,227 individuals with 4,347 scans, 
and 18 fMRI  studies comprising 714 individuals with 1,646 scans. 
For each scan \ndmg~estimates  a ``connectome'' (a functional or structural map of connectivity) at 24 different spatial resolutions---yielding a total of  $>100,000$ estimated connectomes---all of which are publicly available from \url{http://m2g.io}. This is the largest open database of connectomes~\cite{brown2016connected},
and one of the largest mega-analyses (inference across studies) of multi-modal connectomics data to date~\cite{varoquaux2013learning, vidaurre2017discovering}. 



These connectomes provided the data that led us to develop statistical connectomics methods to quantify various connectome properties, such as the relative probability of ipsilateral vs.~contralateral connections and homotopic vs.~heterotopic connections. While these properties have been previously noted in single studies~\cite{Stark2008,Zuo2010,Gee2011}, this work demonstrates that aspects of these properties are preserved both across individuals and studies upon optimizing and harmonizing the pipeline. Nonetheless, within session, site, study, and demographic cohorts, substantial variability remained in the \emph{magnitude} of these properties. 
Moreover, we observed a considerably higher degree of variability across sites, studies, and demographic cohorts. In part, this variability may be due to legitimate biological heterogeneity that could not be accounted for using the limited phenotyping available. However, a substantial portion of that variability is likely reflective of experimental and/or measurement error.
This variability can partially explain recent failures of replicability in neuroimaging~\cite{Button2013}, as well as the lack of clinically useful neuroimaging based biomarkers~\cite{APA12}. This work therefore motivates significant further efforts in measurement and/or analysis to mitigate ``batch effects’’ in neuroimaging. 
Other disciplines with similar findings have resolved these issues by revolutionizing their measurement strategy (for example, genomics moved away from microarrays because sequencing can be significantly more reliable than microarray measurements~\cite{SEQCMAQC-III_Consortium2014-ij})---though only after all efforts to remediate existing methods failed. For imaging, more comprehensively phenotyped individuals, and more coordinated data acquisition protocols, can be a first step towards studies generating sufficiently accurate and reliable inferences and clinical biomarkers.

\section{Results}


\subsection{Individual-Level Analysis}

%\input{figure_ohbm_discr.tex}
%%%%%%%

In the individual-level analysis, each individual  undergoes some number of sessions, during which multiple different modalities can be collected.
The input to \ndmg~for a given individual is  the collection of scans and some metadata for each scan, including a structural scan, % (T1w/MPRAGE), 
and either, or both of, (1) a diffusion scan, including the diffusion parameters files,  and (2) a functional scan, including the slice acquisition sequence.
The individual-level of \ndmg~ analysis leverages existing open source tools, including
the fMRI Software Library (FSL) ~\cite{fsl1, fsl2, fsl3}, Dipy~\cite{dipy}, the MNI152 atlas~\cite{mni152}, and a variety of parcellations defined in the MNI152 space~\cite{desikan, aal, jhu, harvardoxford, talairach, slab907, slab1068, pvt, glasser} (see \ref{app:parcels} for details about built-in parcellations included). 
% @reb: vince says: [hey, we have a number of ICA parcellation schemes, the way we like to use them is to run spatially constrained ICA on new data using these as priors...if you want to do something with this let me know, possible collaboration going forward? ;-) ] let's get them in our set?
All algorithms requiring hyper-parameter selection were initially set to the suggested parameters for each tool, and tuned to improve the accuracy, reliability, expediency, and robustness of the results.
The output of each processing stage includes data derivatives and QA figures to enable individualized accuracy assessments.
The QA figures at many stages include cross-sectional images at different depths in the three canonical planes (sagittal, coronal, and axial) of images or overlays. Example QA figures are provided in \ref{app:dpipe} and \ref{app:fpipe}.
%---which we refer to as QAX---as specified below.
%A crucial component of the design of \ndmg~was to include  quality assurance (QA) figures for each stage to the pipeline, to enable users to easily detect whether or not the pipeline is producing accurate results. 
%Snapshots of these QA figures are shown Figure~\ref{fig:ndmgpipeline}.%, whereas exemplars are provided in \ref{app:pipeline}.

\paragraph{Individual-Level Diffusion Analysis}

The \ndmgd~pipeline consists of four key components: (1) registration, (2) tensor estimation, (3) tractography, and (4) graph generation (see Figure~\ref{fig:ndmgpipeline} for an illustration, and 
\ref{app:dpipe} for further details). It was optimized on the Kirby21 dataset, and then applied to the remaning 10 datasets.
Below, we provide a brief description of each step.

\begin{description}[style=unboxed,leftmargin=0cm]
        \item[Registration] uses FSL's ``standard'' linear registration pipeline % \textit{eddy\_correct}, \textit{epi\_reg}, \textit{flirt}, and \textit{apply\_xfm} 
        to register the structural and diffusion images to the MNI152 atlas~\cite{fsl1,fsl2,fsl3,mni152}. Nonlinear registration, though possibly more accurate~\cite{klein,lddmm}, was not sufficiently robust to include (it often failed on some studies without manual intervention).
    
        %QAX overlays of the dMRI image and the MNI152 atlas.

        \item[Tensor Estimation] uses DiPy~\cite{dipy}
%       's gradient-table, TensorModel, fit, get-sphere, and quantize-evecs
        to obtain an estimated tensor in each voxel. %QAX depicts a fractional anisotropy map.
        \item[Tractography] uses DiPy's \textit{EuDX}~\cite{eudx}, a deterministic tractography algorithm closely related to \textit{FACT}~\cite{fact}, to obtain a streamline from each voxel. %QAX visualizes of a subset of the streamlines within the MNI152 brain.
        Probabilistic tractography, while possibly more accurate, requires orders of magnitude more computational time.  Visual QA of the generated fibers suggested that deterministic was sufficiently accurate for our purposes. 
        \item[Graph Generation] Graphs are formed by contracting fiber streamlines \ref{app:graphgen} into sub-regions depending on spatial ~\cite{glocal} proximity or neuro-anatomical ~\cite{aal, desikan, harvardoxford, talairach, jhu, glasser, pvt, slab907, slab1068} similarity. QA are performed as in the functional pipeline,  described below.
%       Connectomes are created by tracing fibers through pre-defined parcellations.
%As fibers are traced, an undirected edge is added to the graph for every pair of regions along the path, where the weight of the edge is the cumulative number of fibers between two regions. 
\end{description}



%\subparagraph{Registration}
%
%\ndmgd~leverages FSL~\cite{fsl1,fsl2,fsl3} for a series of linear registrations. Taking as input the minimally preprocessed dMRI and T1W images, the end result is the dMRI volumes aligned to the MNI152 atlas~\cite{mni152}. 
%The registration pipeline implemented is ``standard'' when working with diffusion data and FSL's tools.
%The QA figure produced at this stage is cross-sectional images at different depths in the three canonical planes (sagittal, coronal, and axial) of an overlay of the dMRI image and the MNI152 atlas.
%
%\paragraph{Tensor Estimation}
%A voxelwise tensor image from the dMRI image stack using a simple 6-component tensor model from  Dipy~\cite{dipy}.
%The aligned diffusion volumes and b-values/b-vectors files are transformed into a 6-dimensional tensor volume, a single dimension \ndmg~pipeline enables three tiers of analysis: individual-level, group-level, and meganalysis (see 
%Figure for each component of the resulting tensors.
%A fractional anisotropy map of the tensors is provided for QA, again using multiple depths in each of the three canonical image planes.
%
%\paragraph{Tractography}
%Streamlines are generated from the tensors using Dipy's EuDX~\cite{eudx}, a deterministic tractography algorithm closely related to FACT~\cite{fact}.
%Each voxel within the tensor image, confined to the boundary of the brain mask, is used as a seed-point in EuDX and fibers are produced and then pruned based on their length.
%\ndmgd~provides a QA plot visualizing a subset of the generated streamlines within a mask of the MNI152 brain so that the user can verify that their structure resembles that of the fractional anisotropy map generated in the previous step.
%
%\paragraph{Graph Generation}


%Below we provide a brief description of each step, \ref{app:pipeline} provides further details.
%While each of these steps is described here, an in-depth look at the specific models and algorithms implemented at each stage contained within \ref{app:pipeline}.
Individual-level analysis in \ndmgd~takes approximately $1.5$ hours to complete using 1~CPU core and 12~GB of RAM at 1 mm$^3$ resolution.
The individual-level analysis was run on 11 studies, including 3,227 individuals and 4,347 scans. Each dataset generated connectomes across each of the parcellations in \ref{app:parcels}, resulting in 104,328 functional brain-graphs.


\paragraph{Individual-Level Functional Analysis}

The \ndmgf~pipeline can be broken up into four key components: (1) preprocessing, (2) registration, (3) nuisance correction, and (4) graph generation (see Figure~\ref{fig:ndmgpipeline}for an illustration and  \ref{app:fpipe} for further details).
The \ndmgf~pipeline was constructed starting with the optimal processing pipeline identified in Wang et. al~\cite{discriminability} using CPAC~\cite{cpac}. Hyperparameters and further algorithm selection was optimized for reliability based on multiple measurement studies (including test-retest).
Below, we provide a brief description of each step.
%, and \ref{app:fpipe} provides further details.
%While each of these steps is described here, an in-depth look at the specific models and algorithms implemented at each stage contained within \ref{app:pipeline}.

\begin{description}[style=unboxed,leftmargin=0cm]
        \item[Preprocessing] uses AFNI~\cite{AFNI}  for brain extraction, and FSL~\cite{Jenkinson2002,Woolrich2009} for slice-timing and motion correction. 
        \item[Registration] uses FSL~\cite{fsl1, Greve2009,Andersson2007}  to perform a non-linear boundary based registration of the fMRI into the MNI152 space~\cite{mni152}. 
The registration pipeline implemented is ``standard'' when working with functional data and FSL's tools~\cite{cpac}.
%QAX includes various overlays and signal-to-noise images.
%between the fMRI image and the T1w image, and the T1w image with the segmented white-matter used mask for boundary-based registration. 
%During template-alignment, QAX overlays  fMRI image and the MNI152 atlas \cite{mni152} and the T1w image and the MNI152 atlas \cite{mni152}. Additionally, QAX includes voxel-wise signal-to-noise, contrast-to-noise, and mean-intensity images.
\item[Nuisance Correction] uses custom Python code to implement a general linear model incorporating regressors for quadratic detrending \cite{Tanabe, Smith1999}, top five white-matter and cerebrospinal fluid Principal Components (CompCor) \cite{Behzadi2007,Ciric2017174}, and the Friston 24-parameter regressors \cite{Friston1996}. Low-frequency drift is then removed below $0.01$ Hz \cite{Lindquist2009}, and the first 15 seconds of the fMRI sequence are discarded \cite{Bright2016}. 
% @reb: vince says: typically there is a low pass filter applied as well, cutoff somewhere between 0.08 and 0.15.  
% @reb: let's check low-pass fileter post submission.  please add to github? or asana? i think maybe github for pipeline changes?  post in the appropriate place and delete comment here.
\item[Graph Generation] uses custom Python code to compute the average timeseries for all voxels within an ROI, then computes correlations between all pairs of ROIs. 
% @reb: vince says try ICA here, let's add ICA atlas post submission.  
%The resulting $4-d$ functional volume is masked by the MNI152 template \cite{mni152}, and the included voxels are output as the voxel timeseries. Region-of-Interest (ROI) timeseries are created by averaging the intensities of all voxels segmented into a region at each timestep. Regions are delineated by pre-defined parcellations using the same collection as \ndmgd. Correlation matrices are then created by taking the pairwise correlation between each pair of ROI timeseries. 
The functional connectome is then rank-transformed by replacing the magnitude of the correlation with its relative rank, from smallest to largest~\cite{discriminability}.  
%QA for each parcellation pipeline includes the registered functional volume overlaid with the parcellation, the registered t1w image overlaid with the parcellation, the the ROI timeseries per-ROI, and the estimated functional connectome as an adjacency matrix, and  the same graph statistics as for the diffusion connectomes. 
\end{description}


Individual-level analysis in \ndmgf~takes approximately 20~minutes to complete using 1~CPU core and 3~GB of RAM at 2 mm$^3$resolution.
The individual-level analysis was run on 714 individuals with 1,646 scans from 18 studies, generating connectomes across each of the 24 parcellations in \ndmgd, and resulting in 39,504 total brain-graphs.

\paragraph{Multi-Scale Multi-Connectome Analysis}

For both diffusion and functional MRI, \ndmg~downsamples the voxel-wise graphs to obtain weighted graphs for many different parcellation schemes. This includes: (1) neuroanatomically delineated parcellations, such as the HarvardOxford cortical and sub-cortical atlases~\cite{harvardoxford}, the JHU~\cite{jhu}, Talairach~\cite{talairach}, Desikan~\cite{desikan}, and AAL~\cite{aal} atlases; (2) algorithmically delineated parcellations, such as Slab907~\cite{slab907}, Slab1068~\cite{slab1068}, and CC200~\cite{cpac};  and (3) 16 down-sampled parcellations ranging from 70 to 72,783 nodes~\cite{glocal}.  
For each, the \emph{multi-connectome} is defined by the set of nodes from a particular parcellation, and the set of (potentially weighted and/or directed) edges from each modality.

The QA for graph generation includes a heat map of the adjacency matrix, the number of non-zero edges, and several multivariate graph statistics (one statistic per vertex in the graph) including:  betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient, hemisphere-separated degree sequence, edge weight, eigenvalues of the graph laplacian, and locality statistic-1~\cite{glocal}.
We developed the hemisphere-separated degree sequence to indicate the ipsilateral and contralateral degree for each vertex, which we found quite useful for QA.  
\ref{app:graphgenf} includes definitions and implementation details for each of the statistics.
Supplementary Figure ~\ref{fig:multiscale} shows, for a single individual, the graph summary statistics for the multi-connectome (including both functional and diffusion) across the set of atlases described above.

\subsection{Group-Level Analysis}

We ran \ndmg~on the 11 diffusion and 18 functional studies listed in 
Table~\ref{tab:data}.
For each, \ndmg~group-level analysis computes and plots group-level graph summary and reliability statistics. 

%%%%%%%
\input{figure_graphqa.tex}
%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Group Level Implementation Strategy}

Leveraging previous efforts developed in our  ``Science in the Cloud''~\cite{sic} manuscript, multiple scans and studies are evaluated in parallel for participant-level analysis, and the derivatives are pooled for group-level analysis, much like typical map-reduce approaches (consistent with the BIDS app specification~\cite{bidsapps}). The parallel  implementation uses the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud, in particular leveraging their storage (S3) and high performance computing (Batch) services. Data are stored in an S3 bucket enabling  the \ndmg~cloud-API connectome estimation pipeline to process all scans on Amazon Batch in parallel. In practice,  AWS limits the number of parallel threads users are allowed to launch (to prevent accidental spending). After connectome estimation is complete, the same cloud-API exposed by \ndmg~enables group-level analysis to be launched and parallelized across each parcellation for all scans within each study.
%

% or "the"
% 
% ^.
We were able to compute diffusion connectomes at 24~scales for each of the publicly available 2,861~scans (totaling 68,664~connectomes) in under one day and \$1,000. Had we processed each scan in parallel, cost would have remained the same but only taken $1.5$~hours.

\paragraph{Group-Level Graph Summary Statistics}

Each scan's estimated connectome can be summarized by a set of graph statistics, as described above. For group-level analysis, we visualize each scan's summary statistics overlaid on one another. For example, Figure~\ref{fig:graphqa} demonstrates that each diffusion graph from the BNU3 dataset using the Desikan atlas has relatively similar values for the statistics (we use the Desikan atlas for the remainder of the analyses unless otherwise specified). Moreover, it is clear from both the degree plot and the mean connectome plot that the dMRI connectomes from this study tend to have more connections within a hemisphere than across a hemisphere, as expected. For the fMRI connectomes, however, the homotopic connections---that is, connections from one region on a hemisphere to the same region on the other hemisphere---seem particularly strong.
%Supplementary Figure ~\ref{fig:graphqaf} shows example group-level analysis for the same study's functional data.
 
%\ref{app:multi} illustrates how \ndmg~also computes the average value for each univariate and multivariate statistic for each atlas, and demonstrates similarities across scales, indicating that that the basic structure of the connectomes is preserved across different atlases.


%\subsubsection{\ndmgf~Individual-Level Pipeline}

\paragraph{Group-Level Discriminability}
\label{sec:disc}

Group-level results from \ndmg~that include repeated measurements are quantitatively assessed using a statistic called discriminability~\cite{discriminability}.
The group's sample discriminability estimates the probability that two observations within the same class are more similar to one another than to objects belonging to a different class:
\begin{equation}
D = Pr(|| a_{ij} - a_{ij'} || \leq || a_{ij} - a_{i'j'} ||).
\label{eq:disc}
\end{equation}
In the context of reliability in \ndmg, each connectome, $a_{ij}$, is compared to other connectomes belonging to the same individual, $a_{ij'}$, and to all connectomes belonging to other individuals, $a_{i'j'}$.
A perfect discriminability score indicates that for all observations within the group, each connectome is more like connectomes from the same individual than others.
Table~\ref{tab:data} lists the discriminability score of each study with repeated measurements (five dMRI studies and sixteen fMRI).
 \ndmgd~achieves a discriminability score of nearly 0.99 or greater on most studies (the lowest score was nearly 0.9).  \ndmgf~achieves a discriminability score around 0.9 on all studies. 
These high discriminability scores  were achieved by optimizing both \ndmgd~and \ndmgf~on a subset of the data.  Specifically, \ndmgd~was optimized using only the Kirby21 study, to achieve a perfect discriminability score.  Nonetheless, the other studies achieved comparably high discriminability scores, despite the fact that the Kirby21 used a Philips scanner, unlike any of the other studies. Moreover, Kirby21's age distribution is substantially different from several of the other dMRI studies (see Table~\ref{tab:data}).  
Similarly, \ndmgf~was optimized using only 13 of the 18 studies, and yet discriminability on the remaining studies remained equally high~\cite{discriminability}, even though they also exhibited large study demographic and acquisition protocol variability.
Finally, \ndmg~was not optimized explicitly at all on multimodal data, nonetheless, for all datasets with multiple scans per subject with both dMRI and fMRI, using the multimodal connectomes improved (or did not decrease) discriminability relative to either modality on its own.
That \ndmg's discriminability score is robust to data acquisition details and study demographics across modalities suggests that scientific results may also be robust to such sources of variability.

% Note that we invested significant effort in both pipelines to achieve these high discriminability scores, and to our knowledge, no other pipelines have been assessed with regards to discriminability. 
 
 % or any other reliability metric.
%
%The discriminability score obtained if a pipeline produced random outputs is summarized in Equation~\ref{eq:chance}, and is a function of the number of classes, $k$, the number of elements in each class, $M_i$, and the total number of observations, $N$:
%
%\begin{equation}
%C = \frac{\sum_{i \in k}^{k}M_{i}^{2}}{N^{2}}.
%\label{eq:chance}
%\end{equation}
%
%Optimizing \ndmg~with respect to discriminability enables us to minimize the upper-bound on error for any general downstream inference task.
%Using discriminability for optimization also prevents over-fitting to covariate-specific signal (i.e. in contrast to optimizing the pipeline for sex classification).

\subsection{Mega-Level Analysis}

Many sources of variability contribute to the observed summary statistics, including individual- or population-level variation,  and different types of measurement or analysis techniques. By virtue of harmonizing the analysis across individuals and studies, we are able assess the remaining degrees of variability due to measurement and demographic-specific effects. Although population-level effects are expected when comparing two different populations with different demographics, variability across measurements must be relatively small for inferences based on neuroimaging to be valid across these populations. Therefore, we conducted mega-analysis to address these remaining sources of variation.  


\paragraph{Consistency Within and Across Studies}

%%%%%%%
\input{figure_mean.tex}
%%%%%%


Figure~\ref{fig:mean} (top) shows the mean estimated connectome computed from each dataset for which we have both dMRI and fMRI data.  We also calculate the  mega-mean connectomes, that is, the mean derived by pooling all the studies (Figure~\ref{fig:mean}, bottom).  Several group-specific properties are readily apparent simply by visualizing the connectomes:
% @reb: nice, can you make this the default in our neurodata.sty package?
\begin{enumerate}[wide, labelwidth=!, labelindent=0pt, label=\bf{\arabic*)}]
        \item The dMRI connectomes have significantly stronger ipsilateral connections than contralateral connections, meaning connections are more prevalent within hemispheres, on average.
        \item The fMRI connectomes have significantly stronger homotopic connections than heterotopic connections, meaning region A on the left hemisphere tends to correlation with region A on the right hemisphere, more than other regions, on average. 
\end{enumerate}

To formally test these initial assessments we developed statistical connectomics models and methods. Specifically, we developed a structured independent edge random graph model that generalizes the more commonly used  stochastic block model (SBM)~\cite{Holland83} and the independence edge random graph model~\cite{Bollobas2009}. In this new model, each edge is sampled independently, but not identically. Rather, there are $K$ possible probabilities of an edge between a pair of vertices, and we have \emph{a priori} knowledge of which edges are in which groups.  Unlike the SBM 
% @jv: we need to report n and the test details more extensively here, particularly whether it is one or 2-sided (one-sided here)
 model, in which each \emph{vertex} is in a group, here each \emph{edge} is in a group.  We then developed test statistics that are consistent and efficient for this model. Specifically, with sufficiently large sample sizes, the power (the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis) of our test approaches unity for the model under consideration.  Moreover, no other test can achieve higher power with fewer samples under this model (see ~\ref{app:siem} for details).

Using the above described approach, we first quantify the degree to which ipsilateral connections tend to be stronger than contralateral connections (Figure~\ref{fig:siem}A).   
$100\%$ of dMRI connectomes and $99.4\%$ of fMRI connectomes, exhibit stronger ipsilateral than contralateral connections.
The dMRI connectomes typically have a larger difference between ipsilateral and contralateral connections, as evidenced by the magnitudes of differences (Figure ~\ref{fig:siem}A.i). and the cumulative probability of a connectome having a difference that is statistically significantly at any level (Figure ~\ref{fig:siem}A.ii).
We subsequently investigated whether for a given individual, the difference between ipsilateral and contralateral connections was stronger in the dMRI data than the fMRI data. 

Out of $907$ individuals with both dMRI and fMRI scans, $99.9\%$ exhibit  stronger ipsilateral versus contralateral connections in the dMRI scan as compared to their corresponding fMRI scan (Figure ~\ref{fig:siem}A.iii), with $99.5\%$ significant at the $0.05$ level, for example (Figure ~\ref{fig:siem}A.iv).

We applied the same strategy to test whether homotopic connections tend to be stronger than heterotopic connections (Figure~\ref{fig:siem}B). In this case, the results are essentially opposite. Here, $100\%$ of the fMRI and dMRI connectomes exhibit this property (Figure ~\ref{fig:siem}B.ii). Similarly, for nearly all individuals ($99.9\%$) with both functional and diffusion scans, the relative strength of homotopic versus heterotopic connections was stronger in his or her fMRI data than the dMRI data (Figure ~\ref{fig:siem}B.iii), with $99.0\%$ significant at the $0.05$ level (Figure ~\ref{fig:siem}B.iv).  


% @reb: post submission, get PING dataset from gkiar and analyze too
In other words, there is a marked consistency across \emph{all} individuals in \emph{all} studies (18 fMRI studies and 10 dMRI studies) for these most basic statistical properties of multi-modal connectomes. Notably, this result provides compelling evidence that certain connectomic discoveries that utilize only a single study, or even a single individual, without even addressing batch effects, can reasonably be expected to be repeatable across studies. Note, however, that repeatable does not mean correct; the true relative probabilities of ipsilateral, contralateral, homotopic, and heterotopic connections in humans remains an open question.

\paragraph{Significant Variability Within and Across Studies}

%At coarse resolution, each study's connectomes exhibited similar properties. However, t
While the above analysis demonstrates preservation of certain connectome properties both within and across studies, it is insufficient to determine the extent of ``batch effects''--- sources of variability including differences in participant recruitment, screening, and demographics as well as scanner, acquisition sequence, and operator.  Typically, investigators prefer that their results are robust to these additional sources of variance.
 If the batch effects are larger than the signal of interest (for example, whether a particular individual is suffering from a particular psychiatric disorder), then inferences based on individual studies are prone to be unreliable.  
%%%%%%%%
%\input{table_pipes.tex}
%%%%%%%%

Figure~\ref{fig:batch} evaluates the variability of individual scans both within and across studies for dMRI (left) and fMRI (right). For simplicity, we focus on a single parameter for each modality:  dMRI data is evaluated in terms of its average within hemisphere connectivity and fMRI is evaluated in terms of its average homotopic connectivity. Prior to analysis each graph is ``rank normalized'', meaning that its edge weights are converted into the numbers $1,2,...,N$, where $N$ is the total number of potential edges, and where the smallest value is assigned a $1$, the next smallest is assigned a $2$, etc. By virtue of this normalization, each network has the same mean and variance, therefore mitigating certain kinds of batch effects. Moreover, by partitioning edges into only two groups, there is only a single degree of freedom: the average connection strength from one group determines that of the other, and vice versa (see~\ref{app:batch} for details).
The fact that the most salient features when visualizing these connectomes effectively yields a one-dimensional characterization of this property justifies the importance of studying the batch effects of this parameter.   
Dramatic variability in this parameter suggests that more ``fine'' parameters, such as the connection strength between individual regions of interest, will typically necessarily have even greater variability.

Figure~\ref{fig:batch}(A.i) and (B.i) shows fairly dramatic variability both within and across studies, suggesting the presence of significant batch effects in both cases. Figure~\ref{fig:batch}(A.ii) and (B.ii) evaluates the statistical significance of batch effects across studies, demonstrating that many studies, though not all, do exhibit severe batch effects. In this case, batch effect was quantified by determining whether the distribution of connection strengths for one study was significantly different from those of another study.

To further understand the source of this variability, we conducted an extensive within and between study analysis of individuals, including the following six different cases (Figure~\ref{fig:batch}(A.iii) and (B.iii)):
\begin{enumerate}[wide, labelwidth=!, labelindent=0pt, label=\bf{\arabic*)}]
        \item  Across \emph{sessions} for a given individual within studies:  If  session 1  scans tended to be different from session 2 scans within a study, then the ``scan order'' itself can meaningfully impact inferences. While dMRI sessions never resulted in significant scan order effects, $9\%$ of fMRI studies were significantly impacted by this effect.   
        \item Across \emph{individuals} within studies: This analysis quantifies the fraction of individuals in a given study whose scans are less similar to one another than they are to any other scan in the dataset. $6\%$ and $15\%$ of individuals within studies (for fMRI and dMRI, respectively) have significantly different connection strengths.
        \item Across \emph{sexes} within studies: Connection strengths are the same at this coarse level across sexes for each dMRI study, whereas $30\%$ of fMRI studies demonstrated significant differences across sexes.
        \item Across studies within \emph{sites}: Two dMRI and three fMRI sites provided data from multiple studies; thus, while the location and scanner were the same across these studies, certain variability in demographic and acquisition details persisted. Both dMRI and fMRI demonstrated a mix: sometimes these differences were significant, but not always. 
        \item Across studies within \emph{demographic}: four dMRI and four fMRI studies controlled basic demographic variables,  including only Chinese people, about $50\%$ female, and all college age. Even preserving these demographics was typically insufficient to mitigate batch effects, with $2/3$ and $1/2$ of comparisons yielding significant batch effects for dMRI and fMRI, respectively.
        \item Across \emph{all} studies: 10 dMRI and 18 fMRI studies were compared, ignoring acquisition and demographic detail. Over $60\%$ of pairwise comparisons for both dMRI and fMRI demonstrated significant differences, often the maximal significance level given our permutation test.
\end{enumerate} 

Taken together, the above results indicate the existence of many difference sources of variability, even upon harmonizing analyses (Figure~\ref{fig:batch}(C)). Such variability suggests that the reproducibility of both dMRI and fMRI can benefit by further understanding, quantifying,  and mitigating these sources of variability.




\section{Discussion}


%The issues of reproducibility and batch effect spans essentially every discipline of science, although it has been particularly problematic in  omics~\cite{Leek2010-vs, Rosenfeld2010-nf, Chen2011, Nygaard2016-hw, Goh2017-hc} and more recently 
%The potential sources of variability  include
The goal of any scientific investigation is not to characterize the observed sample data’s variance, but rather, to make inferences about the general population on the basis of those data.  
Variability of sample demographics, data acquisition details (for example, number of repetitions for fMRI, number of directions for dMRI), analysis methods, measurement error, questionable research practices, or statistical errors can each contribute to limitations in generalizing to populations in psychology~\cite{Button2013} and neuroimaging~\cite{Costafreda2009}.
Our principles for pipeline development enabled a rigorous high-throughput analysis of multi-study, multi-site, and multi-connectome data to identify and quantify different sources of variability.

While perhaps seemingly at odds, the results from Figures~\ref{fig:siem} and~\ref{fig:batch} are complementary.  Specifically, Figure~\ref{fig:siem} demonstrates that essentially all connectomes share a particular property: stronger connections in one set of edges than another. On the other hand, Figure~\ref{fig:batch} demonstrates that although some sets of edges tend to be larger than others, the {magnitude} of the differences is highly variable both within and across studies. That the \emph{magnitude} of certain parameters can differ while the \emph{sign} of those parameters can be constant parallels recent suggestions from the statistics literature to move away from ``Type I'' and ``Type II'' errors, to Type M (magnitude) and Type  S (sign) errors~\cite{gelman14a}. Moreover, it suggests a strategy to understand and address batch effects: reporting the \emph{precision} for which effects are preserved or variable.  For example, in this study, when using the coarsest possible precision (larger versus smaller as in Figure~\ref{fig:siem}), no batch effects arise, whereas when using an extremely fine precision (the difference in magnitude as in Figure~\ref{fig:batch} ), batch effects are pervasive. The natural question then becomes: at which precision, for a given parameter and source of variability, do the studies still agree? Such analyses could then be incorporated into downstream analyses to preserve results across studies. 







%The \ndmg~pipeline is a reliable tool for structural and functional connectome estimation and analysis with  a low barrier to entry, and is capable of producing accurate brain-graphs across studies.
%
The design criteria for \ndmg~required certain trade-offs, including robustness under variability versus optimality under idealized data.  
% Optimizing \ndmg~for any individual dataset would make it sub-optimal for other datasets.  
Nonetheless, \ndmg, could be improved along several dimensions.
%Below we suggest several strategies that could  improve \ndmg~along various dimensions.
First, 
%several of the algorithm choices required trade-offs between accuracy and expediency, 
recent advances in registration~\cite{lddmm} and tractography ~\cite{probtrackx} could be incorporated.
When implementations for these algorithms achieve suitable expediency and robustness, it will be natural to assess them. 
Second, recently several more sophisticated batch effect strategies have been successfully employed in dMRI data~\cite{Fortin2017-dm}. Such strategies could possibly help here as well, especially if they are modified appropriately to work on binary graphs~\cite{Leek2007}.
%
Third, there is some evidence that machine learning approaches to mitigating batch effects can be effective as well, but so far only in fMRI data and only using four, rather than 18 studies~\cite{abraham2017deriving}.
Fourth, pre-processing strategies have been employed to improve multi-site reliability~\cite{mirzaalian2017harmonization}, so implementing methods such as these within \ndmg~could possibly mitigate some batch effects, at the risk of reducing accuracy and/or reliability~\cite{adhd}.

%Pre-processing strategies have been employed to improve multi-site reliability~\cite{mirzaalian2017harmonization}, implementing  methods such as these within \ndmg~could possibly mitigate some batch effect, at the risk of reducing accuracy and/or reliability~\cite{adhd}.


%Other efforts have focused on multi-study data. Specifically, Abraham et al. \cite{abraham2017deriving}
%%Multi-site predictive tasks have been performed considering 
%used fMRI-derived connectomes from the ABIDE dataset, and demonstrate an impressive ability to minimize batch effects. Unfortunately,  most ABIDE studies lack dMRI data, so a similar strategy for \ndmgd~is not currently possible.  Similarly, concomitant with our manuscript is Noble et al. \cite{Noble2017}, who conducted a multi-scanner analysis with harmonized  fMRI acquisition on 12 individuals.  The compelling results suggest that pooling across studies with harmonized acquisition can potentially improve reliability.
%%and performing similar analyses upon a multi-dataset collection of dMRI-derived connectomes is an exciting avenue for future exploration.
%Additionally, a variety of studies propose methods for post-acquisition data harmonization using either minimally pre-processed or raw MRI data~\cite{mirzaalian2017harmonization,Fortin2017-dm,adhd} that could be explored within the context of the \ndmg~pipeline.





% \ndmg~has been optimized with respect to discriminability, yet  one can always further improve the pipeline via incorporating additional algorithms, datasets, or metrics.  For example, one could further optimize to reduce the batch effect.
%Alternately, one could incorporate probabilistic tractography to compare with deterministic approaches in a principled meganalysis using the open source data derivatives generated here.
%an exhaustive hyper-parameter sweep optimizing each parameter selection in \ndmg~has not yet been conducted.
%Though this has not occurred, an important contribution of \ndmg~is the illustration that highly sophisticated and computationally burdensome algorithms such as probabilistic tractography are not necessary to create reliable estimates of brain connectivity.
%Evaluating the quality of connectome estimation pipelines using probabilistic tractography with discriminability would enable a decisive answer to the question of when deterministic or probabilistic tractography is a more reliable when estimating connectivity, and by how much.




%Several previously proposed fMRI or dMRI pipelines utilize different algorithms which could also be incorporated, but have not been investigated here for various reasons.  CPAC~\cite{cpac}, PANDAS~\cite{Cui2013}, and CMTK~\cite{Daducci2012},   are flexible pipelines enabling users to select hyper-parameters for their dataset. This is a useful feature for many applications, but when the desire is to increase reliability, harmonization is key.
%%This freedom emphasizes the between-dataset differences in connectomes estimated with varying processing parameters, and cannot necessarily be directly compared.
% MRCAP~\cite{mrcap} and MIGRAINE~\cite{migraine} provide reference pipelines, but are difficult to deploy, and also lack vetting across studies. 
%%In the present study, we chose many pipelines for the evaluation while some existing pipelines were not included for such a purpose. 
%%Several analytic pipelines of resting-state fMRI that we did not evaluate above include
%REST~\cite{Song2011}, DPARSF~\cite{Yan2010}, DPABI~\cite{Yan2016}, GRETNA~\cite{Wang2015}, and GIFT~\cite{Calhoun2001-wc} lack command line interfaces and therefore are much more difficult to run at scale in a reliable fashion. 
%%limited to  are very popular with user-friendly graphic user interfaces (GUIs), however, it is not trivial for users to translate them into  computational platforms for  very large-scale neuroimaging data analysis. 
%Surface-based pipelines of rfMRI data such as connectome computation system (CCS)~\cite{Xu2015} and HCP (only volume-based part was included in the current evaluation) will be investigated in future work~\cite{Zuo2013}.


It may be that analysis methods on their own are insufficient to mitigate replicability issues, and that further improving data acquisition and/or data acquisition harmonization may be required. Indeed, a recent study by Noble et al.~\cite{Noble2017} found relatively few batch effects in fMRI data, although it employed only two datasets with enhanced and harmonized data acquisition protocols. 

%that post-data collection stratification to harmonize study demographics effectively to reduce batch effects of fMRI, although only in one much smaller mega-level analysis using  two studies with the same scanner.  


%However, while the algorithms that these pipelines leverage have become standard, the pipelines have not. Indeed, there is a distinct lack of reference pipelines in the field. This has resulted in each publication using  (sometimes subtly) different parameters, often without specifying  precise details and dependencies, making reproducibility difficult.  Moreover, the lack of reference pipelines also creates inefficiencies in the collective scientific process because pipelines have to be designed and tuned for each study, essentially.  


Because the methods developed herein are open source and easy to use, and the data are open access, this work enables further studies to assess measurement errors as well as variability of sample demographics and experimental protocols. For example, data could be sub-sampled to only include scans that pass stringent quality assurance standards, or have a sufficiently long duration to support discriminable connectomes~\cite{Airan17}.
% @EB: update citation.
 Alternately, this analysis could be repeated on data that is ``perfectly'' harmonized. In general, further work developing and applying experimental and theoretical tools to parse the relative impact of various sources of batch effects, as well as batch effect mitigation strategies, will be crucial for neuroimaging to achieve its greatest potential scientific and clinical value. 

%Perhaps even more problematic is that such pipelines cannot readily be used for meganalysis (an approach that pools data across datasets, centers, or studies) because most  are idiosyncratically designed for a particular study~\cite{Costafreda2009}. This stifles our ability to understand and quantify batch effects in neuroimaging, which are extremely problematic in -omics data~\cite{Leek2010-vs, Rosenfeld2010-nf, Nygaard2016-hw, Goh2017-hc}, though relatively understudied~\cite{Olivetti2012-vy, Fortin2016-yq, Fortin2017-dm}.



%The Human Connectome Project (HCP) has recently collected an extraordinary M3R dataset, and developed processing
%pipelines accordingly. It is our belief that \ndmg~is explicitly not in competition with the tools and resources
%produced by HCP. The HCP pipeline when run on the HCP data creates likely the most outstanding map of human brain
%connectivity to date, however, their pipeline relies on many additional parameters and files (such as scanner bias
%fields, and multi-shell acquisitions of dMRI data), making it unable to be deployed across the majority of existing
%dMRI studies. \ndmg~takes the approach of being a generally useful, reliable, and impactful tool, without requiring
%state-of-the-art acquisitions which are not commonly available outside of next-gen experimental paradigms. \ndmg~can be
%deployed on the HCP data, though it would not take advantage of the additional scans and parameters acquired. We
%believe that the HCP pipelines and \ndmg~compliment one another, and comparing the two more closely is an exciting
%avenue to be explored in future work.

The scoring criteria for the principles defined in the main text are defined as follows:
\begin{description}[style=unboxed,leftmargin=0cm]
        \item[Accurate] \greencheck: pipeline results compared with ground truth to assess accuracy, \ocheck: quality control figures and metrics are produced.
        \item[Reliable] \greencheck: reliability has been assessed, using either discriminability or intra-class correlation, by running the pipeline on at least one study, \ocheck: no published results demonstrating reliability
        \item[Robust] \greencheck: pipeline has been run successfully on multiple disparate studies,  \ocheck: no published results on multiple studies.
        \item[Expedient] \greencheck: pipeline runs on a single individual $\leq 2$ hour per scan, \redx: pipeline requires $\geq 2$ hour per scan.
        \item[Parallelized] \greencheck: can run in parallel locally, and can scale to cloud infrastructure (AWS EC2 or AWS Batch). \ocheck: can run in parallel locally or scale to cloud infrastructure. \redx: can neither run in parallel locally nor scale to cloud infrastructure.
        \item[Portable] \greencheck: can run on, and is deployed on, multiple different platforms, \ocheck:  can run on multiple platforms, but is not deployed on any publicly available resources, \redx:  is platform specific.
        \item[Turn-Key] \greencheck: runs without requiring any tuning parameters or configuration files, \ocheck:  given a configuration file, runs without requiring any further tuning, \redx: requires tuning for each run.
        \item[Open] \greencheck: both source code and data derivatives are open, \ocheck: only source code is available, \redx: neither source code nor data derivatives are publicly available.
        \item[dMRI\& fMRI] \greencheck operates on dMRI data (left), operates on  fMRI (right), \redx on either side indicates the opposite.
        \item[Raw-to-Graph] \greencheck: outputs estimated networks, \redx: does not.

%And the cells receiving a non-\greencheck~ were evaluated as follows:

%\item{The CPAC pipeline for fMRI \cite{cpac} is not raw-to-graph: the closest derivative to a functional connectome are the parcellated timeseries, resulting in a \ocheck as the users are only required to perform pairwise correlations of the timeseries.

\section{Diffusion  Pipeline} \label{app:dpipe}

Here we take a deep-dive into each of the modules of the \ndmgd~pipeline. We will explain algorithm and parameter
choices that were implemented at each step and the justification for why they were used over alternatives. All QA/QAX figures shown are from participant 0025864 from the BNU1 \cite{corr} study.
%Recall, the primary concern in development of \ndmg~was the discriminability and robustness of each step. 
%Additionally, we wanted the pipeline to run on non-specialized hardware in a time-frame that didn't significantly hinder the rate of progress of scientists who wish to use it.

\subsection{Registration}
\label{app:registration}


%%%%%%%%%
\input{figure_dwi_reg.tex}
%%%%%%%%%

Registration in \ndmg~leverages FSL and the Nilearn Python package. 
\ndmg~uses linear registrations because  non-linear methods had higher variability across studies and increased the time requirements of the pipeline dramatically (not shown).

The first step in the registration module is eddy-current correction and dMRI
self-alignment to the volume-stack's B0 volume (Figure~\ref{fig:ndmgdetails}). \ndmg~uses FSL's \texttt{eddy\_correct}, rather than the newer \texttt{eddy} function, because \texttt{eddy} requires substantially longer to run or relies on GPU acceleration, which would reduce the accessibility of \ndmg.
%
%providing more sophisticated denoising, takes significantly 
%
Once the dMRI data is self-aligned, it is aligned to the same-individual T1w image through FSL's \texttt{epi\_reg} mini-pipeline. This
tool performs a linear alignment between each image in the dMRI volume-stack and the T1w volume.
%
The T1w volume is then aligned to the MNI152 template using linear registration computed by FSL's \texttt{flirt}. This
alignment is computed using the 1 millimeter (mm) MNI152 atlas, to enable higher freedom in terms of the parcellations that may
be used, such as near-voxelwise parcellations that have been generated at 1 mm. FSL's non-linear registration,
\texttt{fnirt}, is not used in \ndmg~as the performance was found to vary significantly based on the collection
protocol of the T1w images, often resulting in either slightly improved or significantly deteriorated performance.

The transform mapping the T1w volume to the template is then applied to the dMRI image stack, resulting in the dMRI image
being aligned to the MNI152 template in \textit{stereotaxic}-coordinate space. However, while \texttt{flirt} aligns the images
in stereotaxic space, it does not guarantee an overlap of the data in voxelspace. Using Nilearn's \texttt{resample},
\ndmg~ensures that images are aligned in both voxel- and stereotaxic-coordinates so that all analyses can be performed
equivalently either with or without considering the image affine-transforms mapping the data matrix to the
real-world coordinates.

Finally, \ndmg~produces a QA plot showing three~slices of the first B0 volume of the aligned dMRI image overlaid on the
MNI152 template in the three~principle coordinate planes (Figure~\ref{fig:dMRI_reg}).  
%This provides nine plots in total which enable qualitative assessment of the quality of alignment.


\subsection{Tensor Estimation}
\label{app:tensors}


%%%%%%%%%
\input{figure_dwi_tensor.tex}
%%%%%%%%%

Once the dMRI volumes have been aligned to the template, \ndmg~begins diffusion-specific processing on the data.
All diffusion processing in \ndmg~is performed using the Dipy Python package~\cite{dipy}.
The diffusion processing in \ndmg~is
performed after alignment to ease cross-connectome comparisons.

While high-dimensional diffusion models, such as orientation distribution functions (ODFs) or q-ball,  enable
reconstruction of crossing fibers and complex fiber trajectories, these methods are designed for images with  a large number of diffusion volumes/directions for a given image \cite{odf, qball}. 
Because \ndmg~is
designed to be robust across a wide range of dMRI studies, including diffusion tensor imaging, \ndmg~uses a lower-dimensional tensor model. The
model, described in detail on Dipy's website (\url{http://nipy.org/dipy/examples_bcouilt/reconst_dti.html}),
computes a 6-component tensor for each voxel in the image.  This reduces the dMRI image stack to a single 6-dimensional image that can be
used for tractography.
%Once tensor estimation has been completed, 
\ndmg~generates a QA plot showing slices of the FA map derived from the tensors in nine panels, as above (Figure~\ref{fig:dMRI_tensor}).


\subsection{Tractography}
\label{app:tractography}


%%%%%%%%%
\input{figure_dwi_tract.tex}
%%%%%%%%%


%In keeping with the theme of computationally efficient and robust methods, 
\ndmg~uses DiPy's  deterministic tractography algorithm, \texttt{EuDX}~\cite{eudx}. 
Integration of tensor estimation and tractography methods is minimally complex
with this tractography method, as it has been designed to operate on the tensors produced by Dipy in the previous step.
Probabilistic tractography would be significantly more computationally expensive, and it remains unclear how well it would perform on data with a small number of diffusion directions.
%provides a probability distribution for points along streamlines,
%which has been shown to be beneficial when working with higher-dimensional diffusion representations. Ultimately, as
%fibers will be resolved into edges in a graph produced by \ndmg, if probabilistic fibers were generated they would have
%to be thresholded or discretized, limiting the benefit of performing probabilistic tractography even if the diffusion
%model used were high enough order to benefit from it directl   y.
%
The QA figure for tractography shows a subset of the resolved streamlines  in an axial projection of the brain mask with the fibers contained therein (Figure~\ref{fig:dwi_tract}). 
This QA figure allows the user to verify, for example, that streamlines are following expected patterns within the brain and do not leave the
boundary of the mask.


\subsection{Graph Estimation}
\label{app:graphgen}

%The fiber streamlines produced in the previous step are used by 
\ndmg~uses the fiber streamlines to generate connectomes across multiple
parcellations. Graphs are formed by contracting voxels into graph vertices depending on spatial \cite{glocal}, anatomical \cite{}, or functional \cite{} similarity.
%@jovo
Given a parcellation with vertices $V$ and a corresponding mapping $P(v_i)$ indicating the voxels within a region $i$, we contract our fiber streamlines as follows. To form a graph $G(V, E, w)$, we know that $V = \left\{v_i\right\}_{i=1}^N$ is the set of all unique vertices in our parcellation. $E = V \times V$ is a collection of possible edges between different vertex regions. $w: V \times V \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_+$ is a weighting function for each edge in the graph. Here, $w(v_i, v_j) = \sum_{u \in P(v_i)}\sum_{w \in P(v_j)} \mathbb{I}\left\{ F_{u, w} \right\}$ where $F_{u, w}$ is true if a fiber tract exists between voxels $u$ and $w$, and false if there is no fiber tract between voxels $u$ and $w$.

 The connectomes generated are graph objects, with nodes in the graph representing regions of interest
(ROIs), and edges representing connectivity via fibers. 
An undirected edge is added to the graph for each pair of ROIs a given streamline passes through.
%Each streamline is traversed and the ROIs which it passes through are
%recorded, ultimately with an edge being added to the graph for all corresponding pairs of ROIs along a streamline. 
Edges are undirected because dMRI data lacks direction information.
%dMRI imaging provides insufficient resolution to recover the direction of flow, an undirected edge is added. 
Edge weight is the number of streamlines which pass through a given pair of regions.
%, that is, each fiber connectingregions A and B adds a weight of 1 between them in the graph. 
%Other measures such as fiber length or mean FA along the
%streamline have not been implemented but could serve as replacements for fiber count, given that a mechanism for
%combining these values over multiple fibers or normalizing them by the fiber count through a region are also
%considered.
%
\ndmg~uses 24 parcellations, including all standard public dMRI parcellations known by the authors.
% @gk: make a table listing parcellations and the number of parcels for each, as well as the citation/source for each parcellation.
%each of which is publicly available and many typical in the dMRI community.
%The parcellations used in \ndmg~were selected based on availability and use in the dMRI processing community. 
Users may run \ndmg~using any additional parcellation defined in MNI152 space simply by providing access to it on the command-line. To package an additional parcellation with \ndmg, please contact the maintainers.
%Use ofadditional parcellations is trivial with \ndmg, further enabling analysis to occur across a variety of scales and users
%to produce a range of connectomes that compliment one another and can be used either independently or for multiscale
%analyses.
The QA for graph generation depicts a number of graph statistics for each of the parcellation schemes.  We typically generate this figure at the population level, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:graphqa}. The description of all the graph statistics we used is provided in~\ref{app:graphstats}.

\subsection{Preprocessing}
\label{app:fprep}

%%%%%%%%%
\input{figure_fmri_preproc.tex}
%%%%%%%%%

fMRI pre-processing consists of several steps described below (Figure~\ref{fig:fmri_preproc}).


\paragraph{Slice Timing Correction}

Slice-timing is accomplished using the slicetimer utility provided by FSL \cite{Woolrich2009}.
To collect an individual 4D EPI sequence, a 3D volume is constructed as a combination of individual 2D slices. The 2D slices are collected incrementally; that is, we collect each 2D slice for approximately 10 milliseconds, and the entire 3D volume is complete in about 30 2D slices. This gives a repetition time, or TR, for the volume of seconds, depending on the scanner. 
%In response to a stimulus, we expect a typical brain response on the order of 16 seconds. This means that during the course of a single volume being collected, a different amount of BOLD may be present present in the first slice than when the last slice is actually collected \cite{Woolrich2009}, yet the results are recorded as a single timepoint. 
The data are essentially a "sliding snapshot" over the course of one TR; observations are not all at a fixed point in time.

\ndmgf~accounts for slice timing aliasing by accepting a user-provided acquisition sequence (the order in which slices are collected for a single time point). Given the acquisition sequence of the 2D slices, we can compute the TR shift of each 2D slice using the TR information from the header of the brain image. A slice that occurs first in a TR will have a shift of 0, while a slice that occurs at the end of a TR will have a shift of 1. A slice that occurs exactly in the middle of a TR has a shift of 0.5. For each voxel in an individual slice, interpolation is used to re-center our observations to all have a TR shift of 0.5. For slice-timing correction, \ndmgf accepts a slice-timing configuration file, or one of the canonical slice-timing orientations (interleaved, sequential ascending, or sequential descending).

\paragraph{Motion Correction}

Motion correction is implemented using the mcflirt utility \cite{Jenkinson2002}, which is a simplification of FSL's FLIRT registration tool.
During an fMRI scan, participants sit in a small, cramped scanner, often for  5 to 10 minutes. During the course of a study, it is fairly common for participants to move their heads, even if only small amounts. Small shifts will lead to a person's head being in different spatial positions at each timestep \cite{Friston1996}, which hampers our efforts to standardize the spatial properties of each individual's brain down the line through registration. This is because registrations are performed by estimating the registration on the first volume \cite{fsl1, fsl2, fsl3}, after which the estimated transformation is applied across the temporal dimension. This means that if each 3D volume is not aligned spatially, inconsistencies in registration will generally decrease functional connectome quality \cite{VanDijk2012}.

Fortunately, given that the individual's brain structure for each 3D volume is relatively constant (the brain shape itself is not changing in time), a 6 degree of freedom rigid affine transformation for each 3D volume (1 translational and 1 rotational parameter per $x, y, z$ direction the individual could move his/her head) using the mean fMRI slice as the reference, adequately addresses this issue. 

\paragraph{Anatomical Preprocessing}

\label{app:aprep}
To preprocess the anatomical t1w image, AFNI's 3dSkullstrip \cite{AFNI} is used. 3dSkullstrip provides modifications to the BET algorithm \cite{Jenkinson2005} to make it more robust without hyperparameters. Note that 3dSkullstrip renormalizes intensities, so to regain the original intensities, the result is binarized and fed as a step function (essentially making it a mask) through 3dcalc and multiplied voxelwise with the original image, yielding the original image intensities of the brain and excluding the regions determined to be skull.

\subsection{Registration}


\label{app:freg}


%%%%%%%%%
\input{figure_fmri_reg.tex}
%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Self Registration}

To register our input fMRI to our reference T1w image, a three degree of freedom (DOF) affine transformation is estimated with x, y, and z translational parameters with FSL's FLIRT \cite{Jenkinson2001} using the \texttt{sch3Dtrans3dof} schedule file provided as part of the FSL package. The schedule file centers the functional brain on the T1w brain  and tends to improve the initialization of registrations in later steps. Next, a locally-optimized transformation from the fMRI brain to the T1w brain is estimated. Again, this transformation is  robust, and  its hyperparameters are tuned to focus on local features of the input (fMRI) and reference (T1w) spaces in the \texttt{simple3d.sch} FLIRT schedule file. This schedule file is chosen due to the input fMRI potentially having a narrow field of view, resolution constraints, or tearing that will perform poorly using a more global alignment.

A third alignment is then estimated using the locally-aligned fMRI to the structural T1w image using the boundary-based registration (\texttt{bbr}) cost function provided by FSL \cite{Greve2009}. In  fMRI, the white-matter/gray-matter border is fairly apparent because the gray-matter generally shows higher intensities than the white-matter regions. Leveraging this observation, the white-matter boundary can be aligned between the fMRI and the T1w scan with high accuracy \cite{Greve2009}. A six DOF transformation from the fMRI to the T1w image is estimated, and the T1w is then segmented to produce a white-matter mask using FSL's \texttt{FAST} algorithm \cite{Zhang2001}. FLIRT is used with the \texttt{bbr}  cost-function to align the boundaries of the white-matter in the fMRI and T1w scans optimally. This provides a high-quality alignment for intra-modal registration from an EPI to a T1w image. 

\paragraph{Template Registration}

%A sample template brain represents the anatomical average brain of the sample individuals. This anatomically average brain theoretically represents the average brain we will find during our external investigations, allowing minimal alignment on average. For FNGS, we assume that users will be using the MNI152 template \cite{Grabner2006}.

A gentle linear transformation of the T1w brain to the MIN152 template~ \cite{Grabner2006}  is estimated using the local-optimization schedule file from before. We use this local-optimization registration as the starting point for a more extensive 12-DOF global FLIRT alignment than the self-registration case. Given that the template brain will theoretically be less similar than simple translations, rotations, and scalings can provide, a non-linear registration is estimated from the T1w to the template space. This is accomplished using FSL's \texttt{FNIRT} algorithm \cite{Andersson2007}, with hyper-parameter tuning specific for the MNI152 template. This non-linear transformation is applied first to the T1w image. The non-linear transformation is then combined with the result of the self-alignment step and applied to the functional volume. Applying the transformation only once prevents unnecessary fixed-precision multiplications, which can induce numerical errors.

QA figures for the \texttt{registration} step include the preprocessed epi image overlaid on the t1w, the registered epi image overlaid on the template, the registered t1w image overlaid on the template, the white-matter mask used in FLIRT-bbr, the voxelwise mean intensity, the voxelwise signal-to-noise ratio, and the voxelwise contrast-to-noise ratio.

\subsection{Nuisance Correction}

%%%%%%%%%%%%
\input{figure_fmri_nuis.tex}
%%%%%%%%%%%%

\label{app:fnuis}
\paragraph{General Linear Model}

Over the course of an fMRI scanning scan, many sources of noise arise that must be corrected for in order to make quality data inferences. The scanner heats up during a scan (producing a high strength magnetic field for scans lasting up to ten or more minutes, which in turn produces an enormous amount of heat). As the scanner heats, the signal recorded tends to drift (first demonstrated by \cite{Smith1999} who showed that a heated scanner detected "brain activity" in cadavers). This drift has been shown to be approximately quadratic \cite{Tanabe}, so \ndmg~uses a second-degree polynomial regressor.

While spatial motion correction removes the visual impact of head motion, spurious signal artifacts remain present. These artifacts can be characterized by the position of the brain in the scanner over time~\cite{Friston1996}. This temporal relationship can be effectively captured by the current volume and the preceding volume, as well as their squares, so 24 regressors are estimated where we have four regressors (current frame, shifted frame, squared-current frame, square-shifted frame) for each of our six (x, y, z, translation and rotation) motion regressors. These regressors are known as the Friston 24 parameter regressors.

Finally,  fMRI signal is often corrupted by physiological noise,  such as blood flow or vessel dilation~\cite{Behzadi2007}. The top 5 principal components from the white-matter and lateral-ventricle signal capture these additional sources of variance~\cite{Behzadi2007,Ciric2017174}. We estimate CSF and white-matter masks using the \texttt{FAST} algorithm, \cite{Zhang2001} with priors obtained from the MNI152 parcellation \cite{mni152}. This estimated mask is eroded by 2 voxels on all sides to avoid any potential signal distortion from the gray-matter signal, since gray-matter signal is expected to correlate with our stimuli.  Any signal bleeding into the white-matter voxels (since the gray-matter/white-matter boundary has a slight bleed-over region) that could get removed by our PCA could be detrimental to our downstream inferences.

The regressors are incorporated into the design matrix $X$ of the general linear model (GLM) shown in \ref{eq:glm}. For our $n$ voxels, the $t$ timestep BOLD signal, we can decompose $Y_{raw} \in \mathbb{R}^{t \times n}$ as:

\begin{align}
    Y_{raw} &= X\beta + \epsilon, 
    \label{eq:glm}
\end{align}
\noindent
where $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}^{t \times n}$ is a noise term,   $X \in \mathbb{R}^{t \times r}$ is the design matrix, and  $\beta \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times n}$ are the regression coefficients. Minimizing the squared-error loss of $Y_{raw}$ with respect to $X\beta$ will provide an estimate of the coefficients $\hat{\beta}$ of the regressors in $X$:
\begin{align*}
    \hat{\beta} &= (X^TX)^{-1}X^TT_{raw}.
\end{align*}
\noindent
Using the estimate $\hat{\beta}$ for our regressors $X$, the GLM-corrected timeseries is~\cite{Tanabe}:
\begin{align*}
    \epsilon &= T_{raw} - X\hat{\beta}.
\end{align*}
%The regressor-corrected timeseries is  $\epsilon$, since we know that $\epsilon$ are the components of our raw signal that cannot be fit by our design regressors \cite{Tanabe}. 

\paragraph{Low Frequency Drift Removal}

Using the GLM-corrected timeseries, low-frequency drift that may still be present in the functional volume can then be removed . Any physiological response due to a stimulus will have a period of around $16$ seconds (or a frequency of $0.063$ Hz) and will not exceed the period of any stimuli present, as has been shown in \cite{Lindquist2009}. Using this information, sinusoidal fourier modes with frequencies lower than most brain stimuli are removed. Conservatively, we set a threshold of $0.01$ Hz for highpass-filtering out low-frequency noise (this should not remove task-dependent signal as long as our task has a period less than about 100 seconds). Although in this manuscript we only applied \ndmg~to resting state data, we have also applied it to task data, motivating these thresholds.

\paragraph{T1 Effect Removal}

During the fMRI scan, the first few volumes may appear to have brighter intensities as the T1 effects are not fully saturated~\cite{Bright2016}. 
%External attempts to remove the T1 effect include global mean normalization of each slice, both of which have been shown to potentially remove brain signal \cite{Bright2016}. 
\ndmg~therefore discards the first 15 seconds of the fMRI sequence.
%, which tends to account for the majority of contrast-dependent issues. 

\subsection{Graph Estimation}
\label{app:graphgenf}

%%%%%%%%%
\input{figure_fmri_graph.tex}
%%%%%%%%%

Given a parcellation with vertices $V$ and a corresponding mapping $P(v_i)$ indicating the voxels within a region $i$, we first must downsample our voxelwise timeseries. Where $I(v)_t$ is the intensity at timestep $t$ for some $v$. Here, we let $I(v_i)_t = \frac{1}{\left|P(v_i)\right|}\sum_{u \in P(v_i)}I(u)_t$, that is, the downsampled timeseries for a given region is  the average timeseries over all voxels in that region.

The ROI timeseries can be used to estimate a functional connectome. For a graph $G(V, E, w)$, $V = \left\{v_i\right\}_{i=1}^N$ are all of the vertices in the parcellation, $E = V \times V$ is all possible edges between vertices, and $w: V \times V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, $w(v_i, v_j) = \left|cor\left(I\left(v_i\right), I\left(v_j\right)\right)\right|$ is  the absolute temporal correlation of the ROI timeseries between regions $v_i$ and $v_j$.
%For our connectome, we want each edge to represent a relationship between two regions of the brain. Intuitively, we can use our functional timeseries to show similarity between regions, whereby the simplest comparison is in terms of the correlation of functional activity. 
\ndmg~computes the pairwise correlation between each pair of regions. 
The delination of regions is provided by the 24 parcellations described above. 

For each parcellation, the correlations are converted to relative ranks---the lowest correlation gets a rank 1, the second lowest rank 2, etc.---and define the ranks as the edge-weights of the resulting functional connectome \cite{discriminability}.
QA depicts Figure~\ref{fig:fmri_graph}.

%It is often of neurological significance to think of the brain as segmented into regions of neurons performing a similar task based on their spatial layout. To accomplish this, neuroscientists parcellate the registered brains into Regions of Interest (ROIs), whereby individual voxels are labelled on the template atlas. The voxels parcellated into a given are averaged spatially to yield an ROI timeseries. This gives us a significantly downsampled representation of the brain, often yielding in excess of 100 fold compression and also reducing voxel-by-voxel noise that may be present. The downsampled timeseries can then be analyzed using traditional statistical methods with greater robustness and computational efficiency \cite{Poldrack2007}.

\subsection{Group-Level Multi-Scale Analysis}
\label{app:multi}

Figure~\ref{fig:multiscale} top panel shows the group-level summary statistics of diffusion connectomes belonging to same dataset over 13 parcellations ranging from 48 nodes up to 500 nodes; for clarity, an additional 11 parcellations with up to over 70,000 nodes are not shown here. The bottom panel shows the group-level summary statistics of functional connectomes belonging to the same dataset over 5 parcellations ranging from 52 to 200 nodes. 
For each parcellation, vertex statistics are normalized by dividing them into number of vertices in the parcellation, and then smoothed via kernel-density estimation to enable comparison across scales. The kernel-width was computed using Scott's Rule, the default mode for Scipy (\url{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.19.1/reference/generated/scipy.stats.gaussian_kde.html}).
For most of the statistics, the ``shape'' of the distributions  are relatively similar across scales, though their actual magnitudes can vary somewhat dramatically.
%In particular, in Figure~\ref{fig:multiscale}, graphs from the the downsampled block-atlases (DS) appear to be scaled versions of one another, as may be expected because they are related to one-another by a region-growing function~\cite{glocal}.

\section{Statistical Connectomics using a Structured Independent Edge Model}
\label{app:siem}

Let $g=(V,E)$ be a graph, where $V$ is the set of vertices that is shared for all $i$, and $E_i$ is the set of binary undirected edges between pairs of vertices.  Let $A$ be a binary adjacency matrix where $a_{uv}=1$ if and only if there is an edge between $u$ and $v$, that is, $(uv) \in E$. 
Assume $g$ is a realization of a random graph $G \sim F$, which is sampled from a distribution $F$.  
We consider a random graph models that generalizes the stochastic block model, the structured independent edge models (SIEM).  

The SIEM implies that 
%
%%\subsection{Task}
%
%Given: 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item{$n$ samples of graphs, $G_1 = \left\{(g_i)\right\}_{i=1}^n$ from one population, and $m$ samples of graphs, $G_2 = \left\{(g_i)\right\}_{i=1}^m$.
%\item{A graph, $g_i \in G_j$, where $g_i  = (E, V, w)$ for $N=|V|$ regions of interest and $w(v_i, v_j) = w_{ij}$.}
%+ a partitioning of the edges into $E_1$ and $E_2$, where $E_1 \cup E_2 = E$ and $E_1 \cap E_2 = \emptyset$.}
%\end{itemize}
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item{Does the connectivity for the edges $E_1$ exceed those of $E_2$ within a particular modality?}
%\item{Does the difference in connectivity for the edges $E_1$ and $E_2$ of one modality exceed that of another modality?}
%\end{enumerate}
%
%\subsection{Statistical Model}
%
%Assume we have a random variable $A$ which can be characterized by the Stochastic Block Model with parameters $G$, $B$:
%
%\begin{align*}
$    A \sim SIEM(P,\tau)$,
%\end{align*}
where $\tau$ is a grouping of the $|E|$ edges in $G$ into $C$ non-overlapping communities, that is,  
$\cup_{i=1}^{C} \tau_i  =E$, and $\tau_i \cap \tau_j = \emptyset$ for all $i \neq j$. 
$P=[p_1, p_2; p_1, p_2]$ represents the parameters for within and between edge group probabilities. 

Our hypothesis test can be stated as follows:
\begin{align*}
        H_0&: p_0 \leq p_1 \\
        H_A&: p_0 > p_1.
\end{align*}
%\noindent Thus, the test statistic can be $\delta=p_0-p_1$.

\noindent 
Ignoring the subscript for notational convenience, when all edges in a group are sampled independently with probability $p$, then the number of edges in that group follows a binomial distribution. The maximum likelihood estimate of $p$ is 
%
%Assume that the number of edges in each subgraph are binomially distributed with the parameter $p$, we can estimate the number of edges for each group with the pmf (noting that in our case, we are given $n$ and $k$ a priori):
%
%\begin{align*}
%  f_B(p | n, k) &= \begin{pmatrix}n \\ k\end{pmatrix}p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}
%\end{align*}
%
%Then the likelihood function is of the form:
%
%\begin{align*}
%  L(p | n, k) &= \prod_{k=0}^n f_B(n, k | p) = \prod_{k=0}^n \begin{pmatrix}n \\ k\end{pmatrix}p^k (1 - p)^{n - k} \\
%  log(L(p | n, k)) &= \sum_{k=0}^n \log\left(\begin{pmatrix}n \\ k\end{pmatrix}\right) + k\log (p) + (n - k)\log (1 - p)
%\end{align*}
%
%Maximizing with respect to $p$:
%
%\begin{align*}
%    \frac{\delta log(L(p | n, k))}{\delta p} &= \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{k}{p} - \frac{n - k}{1 - p} = 0 \\
%    \frac{k}{p} &= \frac{n - k}{1 - p} \\
$    \hat{p} = \mathbb{E}[p] = \frac{k}{n}$, where $k$ is the number of observed edges in the group, and $n$ is the number of potential edges in the group. 
%This therefore provides us with our test statistic, $\hat{\delta}=\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$. 

%\end{align*}
%To obtain the null distribution of $\delta$, we utilize large sample theory.
We utilize large sample size theory to obtain a p-value.
When $n$ is sufficient large, $\hat{p}$ has a normal distribution, $\mathcal{N}(\mu_p,\sigma_p^2)$, where $\mu_p=p$ and $\sigma_p^2=p(1-p) / n$.  Plugging in $\hat{p}$ for $p$ yields our estimate of the distribution of $\hat{p}$.     
Because $\hat{p}_1$ and $\hat{p}_2$ are different, testing whether they are statistically significantly different boils down to testing whether two Gaussians with different variances are different.
Welch's T-Test ~\cite{welch47} for testing whether populations have equal means given that they have different variances in the univariate case provides out test statistic:
\begin{align*}
    T = \frac{\bar{p}_1 - \bar{p}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}},
\end{align*}
\noindent
where $s_1 = \sigma_{\hat{p}_1},\;s_2 = \sigma_{\hat{p}_2}$. 
The degrees of freedom can be calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
    \nu &= \frac{\left(\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}\right)^2}{\frac{s_1^4}{n_1^2 \nu_1} + \frac{s_2^4}{n_2^2\nu_2}},
\end{align*}
\noindent
where $\nu_1 = n_1 - 1, \; \nu_2 = n_2 - 1$.
The null distribution, and therefore p-value, is available from R, using the \texttt{TDist} family of functions from the \texttt{stats} package.

For the within-modality tests, we first define $p_1$ as the connection probability within a hemisphere, and $p_2$ as the connection probability between hemispheres, and $\tau$ therefore indicates whether a given edge corresponds to an ipsilateral or a contralateral connection.  We then redefine $p_1$ as the connection probability for homotopic edges, and $p_2$ as the connection probability for heterotopic edges, and $\tau$ indicates whether an edge corresponds to a homotopic or heterotopic connection.  

The across-modality tests use the same basic statistical theory; because everything is Gaussian, linear combinations of Gaussians preserve Gaussianity.  Let $\delta^d = p^d_1-p^d_2$ and $\delta^f=p^f_1-p^f_2$. For testing whether the difference between ipsi-lateral and contra-lateral connectivity in the diffusion connectomes exceeds that of the functional connectomes, the across-modality test can be stated as follows:
\begin{align*}
        H_0&: \delta^d \leq \delta^f \\
        H_A&: \delta^d > \delta^f.
\end{align*}
For testing whether the difference between homotopic and heterotopic connectivity in the functional connectomes exceeds that of the diffusion connectomes, the across-modality test can be stated as follows:
\begin{align*}
        H_0&: \delta^f \leq \delta^d \\
        H_A&: \delta^f > \delta^d.
\end{align*}

\noindent A bit of arithmetic provides the definition of $T$ in this setting, again immediately yielding the null distribution and p-value using the \texttt{TDist} family of functions from the \texttt{stats} package in R.

\section{Batch Effect Investigation}
\label{app:batch}

For Batch Effect investigation, we used a simple, intuitive model capturing significant signal as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:siem}. For the dMRI connectomes, our edge communities are the ipsilateral edges in one 

community $C_p$ with average ipsilateral (within-hemisphere) community edge weight estimate indicated by  $\hat{p}$, and the  contra-lateral (cross-hemisphere) edges $C_q$ with average edge weight estimate $\hat{q}$. For the fMRI connectomes, our edge communities are the homotopic vs heterotopic.
%edges in community $C_p$ with estimator $\hat{p}$, and the heterotopic edges in community $C_q$ with estimator $\hat{q}$. 
For this investigation, we rank-normalize the edge weights, which has been shown in \citet{discriminability}

 to increase the individual-specific signature of brain images.
 Let $x_i = (p_i,q_i)$ be the sampled community probabilities for individual $i$, and let $z_i$ denote that individual's ``population'' label (described below in more detail).
Given a dataset, $(x_i,z_i)$ for $i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$,  we assume that each pair is sampled identically and independently from a true but unknown joint distribution: 
%\begin{align*}
$(X_i, Z_i) \iid F_{X, Z}$,
%\end{align*}
%with edge-weights $X_i$ and corresponding labels $Z_i$. Here, $X_i$ are the edge probabilities for each sample $x_i = (\hat{p}_i, \hat{q}_i)$ for each edge community, and the corresponding labels $Z_i \in \mathcal{Z}$ are the labels for the respective investigation, where  $\mathcal{Z}$ the set of possible labels.  
Letting $|z_k|$  denote the number of samples from population $k$ yields the following equations for estimating population averaged edge-weights:
%Then we have $X_i = \left\{x_i : z_i = \mathcal{Z}_i\right\}$ with average estimators per $\mathcal{Z}_i$, $\mathcal{X}_i = \left(\bar{\hat{p}}_i, \bar{\hat{q}}_i\right)$:
\begin{align*}
        \bar{\hat{p}}^a_z = \frac{1}{|z_k|}\sum_{i : z_i = k}\hat{p}_i \\
%    \bar{\hat{q}}_z= \frac{1}{\left\vert\left\{k : z_k = \mathcal{Z}_i\right\}\right\vert}\sum_{\left\{k : z_k = \mathcal{Z}_i\right\}}\hat{q}_k
\end{align*}
%
We desire to test whether the population level averages between two populations differ:
\begin{align*}
        H_0&: \bar{p}_i = \bar{p}_j \\
        H_A&: \bar{p}_i \neq \bar{p}_j.
\end{align*}
We therefore use the following test statistic:  $t= |(\bar{\hat{p}}_i - \bar{\hat{p}}_j) |$, and obtain the null distribution and p-value via a permutation test.
%
%\begin{align*}
%D\left(\bar{\hat{p}}_i, \bar{\hat{p}}_j\right) = |(\bar{\hat{p}}_i - \bar{\hat{p}}_j) |
%%D\left(\mathcal{X}_i, \mathcal{X}_j\right) = \left\vert\bar{(\hat{p}}_i - \bar{\hat{p}}_j) - (\bar{\hat{q}}_i - \bar{\hat{q}}_j)\right\vert
%\end{align*}
To investigate batch effects, we investigate six common pooling strategies with the corresponding labels:

\begin{enumerate}[wide, labelwidth=!, labelindent=0pt, label=\bf{\arabic*)}]
\item{Sessions: pooling within a study across unique sessions (Sessions)}
\item{pooling within a study across unique individuals (Individuals)}
\item{Sexes: pooling within a study across unique sexes (Sexes)}
\item{pooling between studies across unique sites (Sites)}
\item{pooling between unique studies with similar demographics (Demographics)}
\item{pooling between unique studies with no consideration of demographics (All studies)}
\end{enumerate}
%
%For Sessions, Sexes, Sites, Demographics, and All Studies, we devise the following approach. We can define a test-statistic for each unique batch pair $k, l$:
%%
%\begin{align*}
%        \mathcal{T}^a_{kl} = D\left(\bar{\hat{p}}^a_k, \bar{\hat{p}}^a_l\right). 
%\end{align*}
%

% @reb: post submission, let's make the "individuals" one the same as the others.

% as follows. For a given pair, randomly permute $Z$ labels, obtaining random subsets $S_k: |S_k| = \left\{m : z_m = k\right\}$. Then we can define the average estimator $\bar{\hat{p}}^0_k$ of our permuted sets:
%\begin{align*}
%        \bar{\hat{p}}^0_z = \frac{1}{|z_k|}\sum_{i \in S_k}p_i \\
%\end{align*}
%%
%Repeating $np$ times, we can empirically obtain the null distribution for iteration $m$:
%%
%%\begin{align*}
%        $\mathcal{T}^{0, m}_{kl} = D\left(\bar{\hat{p}}^0_k, \bar{\hat{p}}_l\right) $.
%%\end{align*}
%%
%We construct the following hypothesis test for each pair $i, j$:
%%
%\begin{align*}
%H^0_{kl}: \mathcal{T}^a_{kl} \leq \mathcal{T}^0_{kl} \\
%H^a_{kl}: \mathcal{T}^a_{kl} > \mathcal{T}^0_{kl}
%\end{align*}
%%
%with the following upper bound for our $p$-value:
%%
%\begin{align*}
%        p_{kl} < \frac{1}{np+1} \left(\sum_{m = 1}^{np} \mathbb{I}\left\{\mathcal{T}^a_{kl} \leq \mathcal{T}^{0, m}_{kl}\right\} + 1\right)
%\end{align*}
%%
%where  $\mathcal{T}^{0, l}$ is the test-statistic on the $l^{th}$ permutation. If there exists a significant effect of a pooling strategy, we would anticipate that $\mathcal{T}^a > D^0$, as the estimated quantities for each pair $\mathcal{Z}_i = (\bar{\hat{p}}^a_i, \bar{\hat{q}}^a_i)$ will be significantly different from one another. If a particular pooling strategy has a low p-value, this corresponds to $\mathcal{T}^a_{ij} > \mathcal{T}^0_{ij}$ a significant number of times. We add one to correct for the fact that this strategy constructs an upper bound for the $p$-value.
%
%% @rjv: why do we do this instead of the above approach for individuals? write it somewhere, if you would so kindly :) i am guessing it is since the pairs of subjects are so small that it makes estimating the alt and null through the permutation approach require many more samples than we have, whereas this setup presents the question more directly, but correct me if im wrong!
%For Individuals, with the following test statistic:
%
%\begin{align*}
%\mathcal{T}_{ij} = D(X_i, X_j)
%\end{align*}
%
%For each unique individual $l$, where $\mathcal{Z}_l = z_i = z_j$ and $\mathcal{Z}_l = z_i \neq z_k$, we can construct the following hypothesis test:
%        
%\begin{align*}
%H^0_l: \mathcal{T}_{ij} \leq \mathcal{T}_{ik} \\
%H^a_l: \mathcal{T}_{ij} > \mathcal{T}_{ik}
%\end{align*}
%
%Given $A_l =\left\{\mathcal{T}_{ij} : \mathcal{Z}_l = z_i = z_j, i \neq j\right\}$, $A_{\not l} = \left\{\mathcal{T}_{ij} : \mathcal{Z}_l = z_i \neq z_j\right\}$,  we obtain the following $p$-value for each individual:
%
%\begin{align*}
%        p_{l} = \frac{1}{|A_{\not l}|} \sum_{\mathcal{T}_n \in A_{\not l}} \mathbb{I}\left\{\left(\frac{1}{|A_l|}\sum_{\mathcal{T}_m \in A_l}\mathcal{T}_m\right) \leq \mathcal{T}_n\right\}
%\end{align*}
%
%Intuitively, our $p$-value here is the fraction of times that the within-individual estimators are less similar than the between-individual estimators. A significant result indicates that the estimators for a particular individual are significantly similar to one another under the model.

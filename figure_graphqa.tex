\caption{\textbf{\ndmg's group level analysis computes and plots eight connectome-specific summary statistics per modality for each scan, providing immediate quality assurance for the entire study.} In theory, any connectome could be an outlier for any of these statistics, so plotting all of them together is particularly useful (see~\ref{app:graphstats} for details). The top panels  show results for the BNU1 dMRI connectomes, the bottom panels show the results for the BNU1 fMRI connectomes.

              quantify the extent to which the emergent functional connectivity

              dynamics by deriving several summary measures across multiple
              large, independent age-matched samples. Reproducibility was
              demonstrated through the existence of basic connectivity patterns

abstract = {The human connectome at the level of fiber tracts between brain regions has been shown to differ in patients with brain disorders compared to healthy control groups. Nonetheless, there is a potentially large number of different network organizations for individual patients that could lead to cognitive deficits prohibiting correct diagnosis. Therefore changes that can distinguish groups might not be sufficient to diagnose the disease that an individual patient suffers from and to indicate the best treatment option for that patient. We describe the challenges introduced by the large variability of connectomes within healthy subjects and patients and outline three common strategies to use connectomes as biomarkers of brain diseases. Finally, we propose a fourth option in using models of simulated brain activity (the dynamic connectome) based on structural connectivity rather than the structure (connectome) itself as a biomarker of disease. Dynamic connectomes, in addition to currently used structural, functional, or effective connectivity, could be an important future biomarker for clinical applications. The study of how different components of the brain, may they be neurons or brain regions, are connected has become an emerging field within the neurosciences (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009; Kaiser, 2011; Sporns et al., 2004). The analysis of physical connections within neural systems gained momentum around 20 years ago with the availability of information on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans' nervous system (Achacoso and Yamamoto, 1992; White et al., 1986) and the rhesus monkey's visual system of cortico-cortical connections (Felleman and van Essen, 1991; Young, 1992). Now called connectomics, the field aims to discover the structure of brain networks, representing physical connections such as axons or fiber tracts. As a next milestone, the first data sets of the Human Connectome Project are being released. What will the next 20 years bring? Like for genomics, the hopes are that features of the connectome of a patient can be a biomarker for diseases and an indicator for therapeutic interventions. Identifying biomarkers for diseases based on large-scale genome studies has been challenging. Is the link between connectivity and brain disease also over-weighted? What could a structural connectome in principle tell us about the brain organization in health and disease? In analogy to genetics, we may distinguish a genotype and a phenotype of brain organization. The genotype is given by the structural connectivity either observed at the level of individual synapses (microconnectome) or at the level of fiber tracts between brain regions (macroconnectome) (DeFelipe, 2010) and we will refer to this as connectome. As for every novel field, the underlying techniques are still under development (Jbabdi and Johansen-Berg, 2011). Diffusion tensor and diffusion spectrum imaging can give us information on potential structural connections of the macroconnectome. The phenotype represents activity, as seen in fMRI or EEG, or behavior, as for cognitive clinical scores. We refer to these patterns as consequences on dynamics or behavior due to changed brain connectivity.},

               various data processing conditions. Using a set of 30 anatomical
               T1-weighted 3T MRI scans, we investigated the effects of data
               processing variables such as FreeSurfer version (v4.3.1, v4.5.0,
               and v5.0.0), workstation (Macintosh and Hewlett-Packard), and
               Macintosh operating system version (OSX 10.5 and OSX 10.6).
               Significant differences were revealed between FreeSurfer version
               v5.0.0 and the two earlier versions. These differences were on
               average 8.8$\pm$6.6\% (range 1.3--64.0\%) (volume) and
               2.8$\pm$1.3\% (1.1--7.7\%) (cortical thickness). About a factor
               two smaller differences were detected between Macintosh and
               Hewlett-Packard workstations and between OSX 10.5 and OSX 10.6.
               The observed differences are similar in magnitude as effect
               sizes reported in accuracy evaluations and neurodegenerative
               studies. The main conclusion is that in the context of an
               ongoing study, users are discouraged to update to a new major
               release of either FreeSurfer or operating system or to switch to

               results thus give a quantitative support to successive

               Moreover, in view of the large and significant cross-version

              questions remain regarding the common and unique aspects these
              indices capture. The present work provided a comprehensive
              examination of inter-individual variation and intra-individual
              temporal variation for commonly used measures, including
              fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, regional
              homogeneity, voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity, network
              centrality and global signal correlation. Regardless of whether
              examining intra-individual or inter-individual variation, we
              found that these definitionally distinct R-fMRI indices tend to
              exhibit a relatively high degree of covariation, which doesn't
              exist in phase randomized surrogate data. As a measure of
              intrinsic brain function, concordance for R-fMRI indices was
              negatively correlated with age across individuals (i.e.,
              concordance among functional indices decreased with age). To
              understand the functional significance of concordance, we noted
              that higher concordance was generally associated with higher
              strengths of R-fMRI indices, regardless of whether looking
              through the lens of inter-individual (i.e., high vs. low

              concordance states identified via temporal dynamic analyses)
              differences. We also noted a linear increase in functional
              concordance together with the R-fMRI indices through the scan,
              which may suggest a decrease in arousal. The current study

               cognitive paradigms for which detailed models of brain activity
               are not available. Independent component analysis has been
               successfully utilized to analyze single-subject fMRI data sets,
               and an extension of this work would be to provide for group
               inferences. However, unlike univariate methods (e.g., regression

               naturally generalize to a method suitable for drawing inferences

               drawing group inferences using ICA of fMRI data, and present its
               application to a simple visual paradigm that alternately
               stimulates the left or right visual field. Our group ICA
               analysis revealed task-related components in left and right

                 variation present and their impact on resting state fMRI
                 (R-fMRI) measures continue to grow. Although substantial
                 within-site variation can exist, efforts to aggregate data
                 across multiple sites such as the 1000 Functional Connectomes
                 Project (FCP) and International Neuroimaging Data-sharing
                 Initiative (INDI) datasets amplify these concerns. The present
                 work draws upon standardization approaches commonly used in
                 the microarray gene expression literature, and to a lesser
                 extent recent imaging studies, and compares them with respect
                 to their impact on relationships between common R-fMRI
                 measures and nuisance variables (e.g., imaging site, motion),
                 as well as phenotypic variables of interest (age, sex).
                 Standardization approaches differed with regard to whether
                 they were applied post-hoc vs. during pre-processing, and at
                 the individual vs. group level; additionally they varied in
                 whether they addressed additive effects vs.
                 additive+multiplicative effects, and were parametric vs.
                 non-parametric. While all standardization approaches were
                 effective at reducing undesirable relationships with nuisance
                 variables, post-hoc approaches were generally more effective
                 than global signal regression (GSR). Across approaches,
                 correction for additive effects (global mean) appeared to be
                 more important than for multiplicative effects (global SD) for
                 all R-fMRI measures, with the exception of amplitude of low
                 frequency fluctuations (ALFF). Group-level post-hoc
                 standardizations for mean-centering and
                 variance-standardization were found to be advantageous in
                 their ability to avoid the introduction of artifactual
                 relationships with standardization parameters; though results
                 between individual and group-level post-hoc approaches were
                 highly similar overall. While post-hoc standardization
                 procedures drastically increased test-retest (TRT) reliability
                 for ALFF, modest reductions were observed for other measures
                 after post-hoc standardizations-a phenomena likely
                 attributable to the separation of voxel-wise from global
                 differences among subjects (global mean and SD demonstrated
                 moderate TRT reliability for these measures). Finally, the
                 present work calls into question previous observations of
                 increased anatomical specificity for GSR over mean centering,
                 and draws attention to the near equivalence of global and gray
                 matter signal regression.",

              Unlabeled observations are always beneficial to classification if

A consortium of HCP investigators will study a population of 1200 healthy adults using multiple imaging modalities, along with extensive behavioral and genetic data. In this overview, we focus on diffusion MRI (dMRI) and the structural connectivity aspect of the project. We present recent advances in acquisition and processing that allow us to obtain very high-quality in-vivo MRI data, while enabling scanning of a very large number of subjects. These advances result from 2 years of intensive efforts in optimising many aspects of data acquisition and processing during the piloting phase of the project. The data quality and methods described here are representative of the datasets and processing pipelines that will be made freely available to the community at quarterly intervals, beginning in 2013.},

abstract = {Stochastic blockmodels have been proposed as a tool for detecting community structure in net-works as well as for generating synthetic networks for use as benchmarks. Most blockmodels, however, ignore variation in vertex degree, making them unsuitable for applications to real-world networks, which typically display broad degree distributions that can significantly distort the results. Here we demonstrate how the generalization of blockmodels to incorporate this missing element leads to an improved objective function for community detection in complex networks. We also propose a heuristic algorithm for community detection using this objective function or its non-degree-corrected counterpart and show that the degree-corrected version dramatically outperforms the uncorrected one in both real-world and synthetic networks.},

abstract = {Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is widely used in both scientific research and clinical practice in in-vivo studies of the human brain. While a number of post-processing packages have been developed, fully automated processing of dMRI datasets remains challenging. Here, we developed a MATLAB toolbox named "Pipeline for Analyzing braiN Diffusion imAges" (PANDA) for fully automated processing of brain diffusion images. The processing modules of a few established packages, including FMRIB Software Library (FSL), Pipeline System for Octave and Matlab (PSOM), Diffusion Toolkit and MRIcron, were employed in PANDA. Using any number of raw dMRI datasets from different subjects, in either DICOM or NIfTI format, PANDA can automatically perform a series of steps to process DICOM/NIfTI to diffusion metrics [e.g., fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD)] that are ready for statistical analysis at the voxel-level, the atlas-level and the Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS)-level and can finish the construction of anatomical brain networks for all subjects. In particular, PANDA can process different subjects in parallel, using multiple cores either in a single computer or in a distributed computing environment, thus greatly reducing the time cost when dealing with a large number of datasets. In addition, PANDA has a friendly graphical user interface (GUI), allowing the user to be interactive and to adjust the input/output settings, as well as the processing parameters. As an open-source package, PANDA is freely available at http://www.nitrc.org/projects/panda/. This novel toolbox is expected to substantially simplify the image processing of dMRI datasets and facilitate human structural connectome studies.},

abstract={Low-frequency fluctuations in fMRI signal have been used to map several consistent resting state networks in the brain. Using the posterior cingulate cortex as a seed region, functional connectivity analyses have found not only positive correlations in the default mode network but negative correlations in another resting state network related to attentional processes. The interpretation is that the human brain is intrinsically organized into dynamic, anti-correlated functional networks. Global variations of the BOLD signal are often considered nuisance effects and are commonly removed using a general linear model (GLM) technique. This global signal regression method has been shown to introduce negative activation measures in standard fMRI analyses. The topic of this paper is whether such a correction technique could be the cause of anti-correlated resting state networks in functional connectivity analyses. Here we show that, after global signal regression, correlation values to a seed voxel must sum to a negative value. Simulations also show that small phase differences between regions can lead to spurious negative correlation values. A combination breath holding and visual task demonstrates that the relative phase of global and local signals can affect connectivity measures and that, experimentally, global signal regression leads to bell-shaped correlation value distributions, centred on zero. Finally, analyses of negatively correlated networks in resting state data show that global signal regression is most likely the cause of anti-correlations. These results call into question the interpretation of negatively correlated regions in the brain when using global signal regression as an initial processing step.},

abstract={Synchronized low-frequency BOLD fluctuations are observed in dissociable large-scale, distributed networks with functional specialization. Two such networks, referred to as the task-positive network (TPN) and the task-negative network (TNN) because they tend to be active or inactive during cognitively demanding tasks, show reproducible anticorrelation of resting BOLD fluctuations after removal of the global brain signal. Because global signal regression mandates that anticorrelated regions to a given seed region must exist, it is unclear whether such anticorrelations are an artifact of global regression or an intrinsic property of neural activity. In this study, we demonstrate from simulated data that spurious anticorrelations are introduced during global regression for any two networks as a linear function of their size. Using actual resting state data, we also show that both the TPN and TNN become anticorrelated with the orbits when soft tissues are included in the global regression algorithm. Finally, we propose a technique using phase-shifted soft tissue regression (PSTCor) that allows improved correction of global physiological artifacts without global regression that shows improved anatomic specificity to global regression but does not show significant network anticorrelations. These results imply that observed anticorrelations between TNN and TPN may be largely or entirely artifactual in the resting state. These results also imply that differences in network anticorrelations attributed to pathophysiological or behavioral states may be due to differences in network size or recruitment rather than actual anticorrelations.},

                Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-FMRI) holds the promise of revealing brain functional connectivity without requiring specific tasks targeting particular brain systems. RS-FMRI is being used to find differences between populations even when a specific candidate target for traditional inferences is lacking. However, the problem with RS-FMRI is a lacking definition of what constitutes noise and signal. RS-FMRI is easy to acquire but is not easy to analyze or draw inferences from. In this commentary we discuss a problem that is still treated lightly despite its significant impact on RS-FMRI inferences; global signal regression (GSReg), the practice of projecting out signal averaged over the entire brain, can change resting-state correlations in ways that dramatically alter correlation patterns and hence conclusions about brain functional connectedness. Although Murphy et al. in 2009 demonstrated that GSReg negatively biases correlations, the approach remains in wide use. We revisit this issue to argue the problem that GSReg is more than negative bias or the interpretability of negative correlations. Its usage can fundamentally alter interregional correlations within a group, or their differences between groups. We used an illustrative model to clearly convey our objections and derived equations formalizing our conclusions. We hope this creates a clear context in which counterarguments can be made. We conclude that GSReg should not be used when studying RS-FMRI because GSReg biases correlations differently in different regions depending on the underlying true interregional correlation structure. GSReg can alter local and long-range correlations, potentially spreading underlying group differences to regions that may never have had any. Conclusions also apply to substitutions of GSReg for denoising with decompositions of signals aggregated over the network's regions to the extent they cannot separate signals of interest from noise. We touch on the need for careful accounting of nuisance parameters when making group comparisons of correlation maps.

                 other imaging modalities, DTI images suffer from technical
                 between-scanner variation that hinders comparisons of images

The aim of this paper is to present an extension of this model in which the edges are far from inde-pendent, and to prove several results about this extension. The basic idea is to construct the random graph by adding not only edges but also other small graphs. In other words, we first construct an inhomogeneous ran-dom hypergraph with (conditionally) independent hyperedges, and then replace each hyperedge by a (perhaps complete) graph. Although flexi-ble enough to produce graphs with significant dependence between edges, this model is nonetheless mathematically tractable. Indeed, we find the critical point where a giant component emerges in full generality, in terms of the norm of a certain integral operator, and relate the size of the giant component to the survival probability of a certain (non-Poisson) multi-type branching process. While our main focus is the phase transition, we also study the degree distribution and the numbers of small subgraphs. We illustrate the model with a simple special case that produces graphs with power-law degree sequences with a wide range of degree exponents and clustering coefficients.},

  abstract = "The Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects the
              school-age population and has large social costs. The scientific
              community is still lacking a pathophysiological model of the
              disorder and there are no objective biomarkers to support the
              diagnosis. In 2011 the ADHD-200 Consortium provided a rich,
              heterogeneous neuroimaging dataset aimed at studying neural
              correlates of ADHD and to promote the development of systems for
              automated diagnosis. Concurrently a competition was set up with
              the goal of addressing the wide range of different types of data
              for the accurate prediction of the presence of ADHD. Phenotypic
              information, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
              and resting state fMRI recordings were provided for nearly 1000
              typical and non-typical young individuals. Data were collected by
              eight different research centers in the consortium. This work is
              not concerned with the main task of the contest, i.e., achieving
              a high prediction accuracy on the competition dataset, but we
              rather address the proper handling of such a heterogeneous
              dataset when performing classification-based analysis. Our
              interest lies in the clustered structure of the data causing the
              so-called batch effects which have strong impact when assessing
              the performance of classifiers built on the ADHD-200 dataset. We
              propose a method to eliminate the biases introduced by such batch
              effects. Its application on the ADHD-200 dataset generates such a
              significant drop in prediction accuracy that most of the
              conclusions from a standard analysis had to be revised. In
              addition we propose to adopt the dissimilarity representation to
              set up effective representation spaces for the heterogeneous
              ADHD-200 dataset. Moreover we propose to evaluate the quality of
              predictions through a recently proposed test of independence in

                 Speed, 2012], two batch effect correction tools largely used

                 registered to a template into a biological component and an
                 unwanted variation component. The unwanted variation component
                 is estimated from a control region obtained from the
                 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where intensities are known to be
                 unassociated with disease status and other clinical
                 covariates. We perform a singular value decomposition (SVD) of
                 the control voxels to estimate factors of unwanted variation.
                 We then estimate the unwanted factors using linear regression

                 subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive
                 impairment (MCI), as well as healthy controls from the

                 We compare RAVEL to two intensity-normalization-only methods:
                 histogram matching and White Stripe. We show that RAVEL
                 performs best at improving the replicability of the brain

                 reproducibility are analyzed. All of them belong to the
                 category of interpretive weaknesses of DNA microarray
                 technology. First, the attention is drawn to the fact that
                 absence of the information regarding post-transcriptional mRNA
                 stability makes it impossible to evaluate the level of gene
                 activity from the relative mRNA abundances, the quantities
                 available from microarray measurements. Second, irreducible
                 intracellular variability with persistent patterns of
                 stochasticity and burstiness put natural limits to
                 reproducibility. Third, strong interactions within
                 intracellular biomolecular networks make it highly problematic
                 to build a bridge between transcription rates of individual
                 genes and structural fidelity of their genetic codes. For
                 these reasons, the microarray measurements of relative mRNA
                 abundances are more appropriate in laboratory settings as a
                 tool for scientific research, hypotheses generating and
                 producing the leads for subsequent validation through more
                 sophisticated technologies. As to clinical settings, where
                 firm conclusive diagnoses, not the leads for further
                 experimentation, are required, microarrays still have a long

                 differences is generally required when such effects are
                 present in data. In particular, when preparing microarray gene
                 expression data from multiple cohorts, array platforms, or
                 batches for later analyses, batch effects can have confounding
                 effects, inducing spurious differences between study groups.
                 Many methods and tools exist for removing batch effects from
                 data. However, when study groups are not evenly distributed
                 across batches, actual group differences may induce apparent
                 batch differences, in which case batch adjustments may bias,
                 usually deflate, group differences. Some tools therefore have
                 the option of preserving the difference between study groups,
                 e.g. using a two-way ANOVA model to simultaneously estimate
                 both group and batch effects. Unfortunately, this approach may
                 systematically induce incorrect group differences in
                 downstream analyses when groups are distributed between the

              used to estimate brain functional organization---or ``functional
              connectivity.'' Standards have been proposed based on
              test--retest reliability, but open questions remain. These
              include how amount of data per subject influences whole-brain
              reliability, the influence of increasing runs versus sessions,
              the spatial distribution of reliability, the reliability of
              multivariate methods, and, crucially, how reliability maps onto
              prediction of behavior. We collected a dataset of 12 extensively
              sampled individuals (144 min data each across 2 identically
              configured scanners) to assess test--retest reliability of
              whole-brain connectivity within the generalizability theory
              framework. We used Human Connectome Project data to replicate
              these analyses and relate reliability to behavioral prediction.
              Overall, the historical 5-min scan produced poor reliability
              averaged across connections. Increasing the number of sessions
              was more beneficial than increasing runs. Reliability was lowest
              for subcortical connections and highest for within-network
              cortical connections. Multivariate reliability was greater than
              univariate. Finally, reliability could not be used to improve
              prediction; these findings are among the first to underscore this
              distinction for functional connectivity. A comprehensive
              understanding of test--retest reliability, including its
              limitations, supports the development of best practices in the

There are thousands MRI studies performed every year generating a substantial amount of data. At the same time, many new data analysis methods are being developed every year. The potential of using new analysis methods on the variety of existing and newly acquired data is hindered by difficulties in software deployment and lack of support for standardized input data. Here we propose to use container technology to make deployment of a wide range of data analysis techniques easy. In addition, we adapt the existing data analysis tools to interface with data organized in a standardized way. We hope that this approach will enable researchers to access a wider range of methods when analyzing their data which will lead to accelerated progress in human neuroscience.},

abstract = {Typically in neuroimaging we are looking to extract some pertinent information from imperfect, noisy images of the brain. This might be the inference of percent changes in blood flow in perfusion FMRI data, segmentation of subcortical structures from structural MRI, or inference of the probability of an anatomical connection between an area of cortex and a subthalamic nucleus using diffusion MRI. In this article we will describe how Bayesian techniques have made a significant impact in tackling problems such as these, particularly in regards to the analysis tools in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL). We shall see how Bayes provides a framework within which we can attempt to infer on models of neuroimaging data, while allowing us to incorporate our prior belief about the brain and the neuroimaging equipment in the form of biophysically informed or regularising priors.

abstract = {In this study, we have assessed the validity and reliability of an automated labeling system that we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance images into gyral based regions of interest (ROIs). Using a dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs, and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in which MRI-based measures are used to examine response to treatment.},

abstract = {The human visual system contains an array of topographically organized regions. Identifying these regions in individual subjects is a powerful approach to group-level statistical analysis, but this is not always feasible. We addressed this limitation by generating probabilistic maps of visual topographic areas in 2 standardized spaces suitable for use with adult human brains. Using standard fMRI paradigms, we identified 25 topographic maps in a large population of individual subjects (N = 53) and transformed them into either a surface-or volume-based standardized space. Here, we provide a quantitative characterization of the inter-subject variability within and across visual regions, including the likelihood that a given point would be classified as a part of any region (full probability map) and the most probable region for any given point (maximum probability map). By evaluating the topographic organization across the whole of visual cortex, we provide new information about the organization of individual visual field maps and large-scale biases in visual field coverage. Finally, we validate each atlas for use with independent subjects. Overall, the probabilistic atlases quantify the variability of topographic representations in human cortex and provide a useful reference for comparing data across studies that can be transformed into these standard spaces.},

@article{klein,
abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO, SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms ("SPM2-type" and regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings of this study is that the relative performances of the registration methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high accuracy across subjects and label sets.

Until now such maps have relied largely on only a single property such as micro-architecture or functional imaging, have been based on a relatively small number of individuals, and have usually been blurry due to misalignment of brain areas from person to person. Matthew Glasser, David Van Essen and colleagues have tackled these deficiencies in a new more 'universal' map of the human cerebral cortex by integrating multi-modal imaging data obtained from 210 healthy subjects and validated on 210 other individuals. The authors propose a total of 180 areas per cerebral hemisphere (97 of them previously unknown) and apply a machine-learning classifier to automatically identify these areas in new subjects, even in individuals with atypical parcellations.

abstract = {Functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) has been widely applied to explore group and individual differences. A confounding factor is head motion. Children move more than adults, older adults more than younger adults, and patients more than controls. Head motion varies considerably among individuals within the same population. Here we explored the influence of head motion on fcMRI estimates. Mean head displacement, maximum head displacement, the number of micro movements ({\textgreater}0.1 mm), and head rotation were estimated in 1000 healthy, young adult subjects each scanned for two resting-state runs on matched 3T scanners. The majority of fcMRI variation across subjects was not linked to head motion. However, head motion had significant, systematic effects on fcMRI network measures. Head motion was associated with decreased functional coupling in the default and frontoparietal control networks--two networks characterized by coupling among distributed regions of association cortex. Other network measures increased with motion including estimates of local functional coupling and coupling between left and right motor regions--a region pair sometimes used as a control in studies to establish specificity. Comparisons between groups of individuals with subtly different levels of head motion yielded difference maps that could be mistaken for neuronal effects in other contexts. These effects are important to consider when interpreting variation between groups and across individuals.},

abstract = {Registration is an important component of medical image analysis and for analysing large amounts of data it is desirable to have fully automatic registration methods. Many different automatic registration methods have been proposed to date, and almost all share a common mathematical framework - one of optimising a cost function. To date little attention has been focused on the optimisation method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimisation. This paper examines the assumptions underlying the problem of registration for brain images using inter-modal voxel similarity measures. It is demonstrated that the use of local optimisation methods together with the standard multi-resolution approach is not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum. To address this problem, a global optimisation method is proposed that is specifically tailored to this form of registration. A full discussion of all the necessary implementation details is included as this is an important part of any practical method. Furthermore, results are presented for inter-modal, inter-subject registration experiments that show that the proposed method is more reliable at finding the global minimum than several of the currently available registration packages in common usage.},

Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid global-local optimization method. This new optimization method is specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It substantially reduces the likelihood of producing misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition, the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of experiments with motion correction. These motion correction experiments also investigate how the results are affected by different cost functions and interpolation methods.},

abstract = {Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB), Oxford, UK Objective Finding brain, skull and scalp surfaces has impor-tant applications, especially in EEG/MEG mod-elling, where this allows one to use more accurate models than those often used at present. BET2 (Brain Extraction Tool v2) is a fast and fully au-tomated tool for extracting brain, inner and outer skull and scalp surfaces from MR images. It ideally requires a pair of T1-and T2-weighted images, preferably of 2mm resolution. BET2 can output mesh surfaces (useful for BEM-based algorithms) and filled images (useful for FEM-based methods). BET2 is based on BET [Smith 2002], which finds the brain boundary given an MR image. BET can attempt to find external skull surface voxels, but does not fit a surface to this, and the result-ing crude " skull " image contains a relatively large number of false negatives and positives. Method BET2 uses high-resolution T1-and T2-weighted images, though can run (with less accuracy) given only a T1. First, the brain surface is found us-ing the original BET algorithm using the T1. The T2 is then registered to the T1, normally using FLIRT [Jenkinson 2002]. Generally, in an MR image, the skull appears darker than brain and other tissues. Its inten-sity is comparable to that of background. In T1-weighted images, CSF is dark, sometimes as low as air/skull. In T2, CSF is bright, and muscles are often dark (making muscle hard to distinguish from skull). The relative intensity of brain and scalp on T1 can vary a lot from one scanner to another. In or-der to increase the robustness to these variations, we constrain the maximum scalp intensity rela-tive to the brain intensities. To avoid the problem of over-bright scalp, we compute a maximum in-tensity threshold; we take the " robust range " of intensities within the extracted brain volume (this being the 2{\%} and 98{\%} points in the cumulative histogram of brain voxel intensities) and increase the upper value by 10{\%} of this range. We then clamp all voxels (in the whole-head image) to this. For each vertex on the brain surface, the perpen-dicular direction is searched outwards for estima-tion of 3 points -the inner and outer skull, and the outer scalp. Various rules are used, which are now presented in simplified form. First, the outer scalp point is found, by combin-ing the outermost non-dark T1 point and the out-ermost non-dark T2 point (thresholds determined from robust histogramming). Next, the inner skull point is found as a combina-tion of searches (outwards from the brain) for the " first dark " T1 and T2 points. The outer skull point is harder to find robustly, due to topological complications in certain re-gions and the presence of bone marrow within the skull; a more complex combination of the T2 and T1 profiles is used to identify the most likely point, followed by correction on the basis of prox-imity to the inner skull point. This approach de-tects correctly the outer skull points in much of the head, but fails in the lower areas, where tis-sues and skull topology are too complex. Thus we have an alternative algorithm for those areas. To determine the area in which this alternative al-gorithm is needed, we use a priori spatial knowl-edge: this area has been manually determined in standard space and consists of a lower, frontal re-gion. We use FLIRT to derive a standard space transform matrix and transform this mask into the space of our data. The outer skin and inner skull points are detected as explained above. The outer skull is detected as the first point over a 35{\%} threshold after the first point under a 25{\%} thresh-old on the T1 profile. If this first point is too far (greater than 7mm) outside the inner skull we re-vert to the simplified assumption that the outer skull point is 0.5mm outside the inner skull point. Finally, an image is created for each of the 3 sur-faces, using the points found; these are slightly blurred (HWHM=3mm) primarily to increase the " attraction area " for mesh fitting. Deformable meshes are then fit to these images for all sur-faces, with cross-and self-intersection prevented.},

abstract = {This document describes the principles behind and the implementation of fnirt, the FMRIB tool for small-displacement non-linear registration. The displacement fields are modelled as linear combinations of basis-functions, which may be the discrete Cosine transform (DCT) or cubic B-splines placed on a regular grid. Regularisation of the field is based on membrane energy. At present the registration is based on a weighted sum of scaled sum-of-squared differences and me-brane energy. Great effort has been placed on the optimisation, and on providing computational tools to enable robust and rapid convergence even for relatively high resolution of the warps. The results that are presented are based on a multi-scale Levenberg-Marquardt minimisation. The registration is initialised and run to convergence with sub-sampled images, a field of low resolution and a high regularisation weight. The images and the fields from the first step are then up-sampled, the regularisation modified and it is again run to convergence. This is repeated until the required warp-resolution and level of regularisation is achieved. The method has been tested with promising results on T1-weighted structural images and on FA-images from DTI acqusitions.},

abstract = {The fine spatial scales of the structures in the human brain represent an enormous challenge to the successful integration of information from different images for both within- and between-subject analysis. While many algorithms to register image pairs from the same subject exist, visual inspection shows that their accuracy and robustness to be suspect, particularly when there are strong intensity gradients and/or only part of the brain is imaged. This paper introduces a new algorithm called Boundary-Based Registration, or BBR. The novelty of BBR is that it treats the two images very differently. The reference image must be of sufficient resolution and quality to extract surfaces that separate tissue types. The input image is then aligned to the reference by maximizing the intensity gradient across tissue boundaries. Several lower quality images can be aligned through their alignment with the reference. Visual inspection and fMRI results show that BBR is more accurate than correlation ratio or normalized mutual information and is considerably more robust to even strong intensity inhomogeneities. BBR also excels at aligning partial-brain images to whole-brain images, a domain in which existing registration algorithms frequently fail. Even in the limit of registering a single slice, we show the BBR results to be robust and accurate.},

abstract = {A B S T R A C T In resting state fMRI, it is necessary to remove signal variance associated with noise sources, leaving cleaned fMRI time-series that more accurately reflect the underlying intrinsic brain fluctuations of interest. This is commonly achieved through nuisance regression, in which the fit is calculated of a noise model of head motion and physiological processes to the fMRI data in a General Linear Model, and the " cleaned " residuals of this fit are used in further analysis. We examine the statistical assumptions and requirements of the General Linear Model, and whether these are met during nuisance regression of resting state fMRI data. Using toy examples and real data we show how pre-whitening, temporal filtering and temporal shifting of regressors impact model fit. Based on our own observations, existing literature, and statistical theory, we make the following recommendations when employing nuisance regression: pre-whitening should be applied to achieve valid statistical inference of the noise model fit parameters; temporal filtering should be incorporated into the noise model to best account for changes in degrees of freedom; temporal shifting of regressors, although merited, should be achieved via optimisation and validation of a single temporal shift. We encourage all readers to make simple, practical changes to their fMRI denoising pipeline, and to regularly assess the appropriateness of the noise model used. By negotiating the potential pitfalls described in this paper, and by clearly reporting the details of nuisance regression in future manuscripts, we hope that the field will achieve more accurate and precise noise models for cleaning the resting state fMRI time-series.},

abstract = "Abstract Since initial reports regarding the impact of motion artifact on measures of functional connectivity, there has been a proliferation of participant-level confound regression methods to limit its impact. However, many of the most commonly used techniques have not been systematically evaluated using a broad range of outcome measures. Here, we provide a systematic evaluation of 14 participant-level confound regression methods in 393 youths. Specifically, we compare methods according to four benchmarks, including the residual relationship between motion and connectivity, distance-dependent effects of motion on connectivity, network identifiability, and additional degrees of freedom lost in confound regression. Our results delineate two clear trade-offs among methods. First, methods that include global signal regression minimize the relationship between connectivity and motion, but result in distance-dependent artifact. In contrast, censoring methods mitigate both motion artifact and distance-dependence, but use additional degrees of freedom. Importantly, less effective de-noising methods are also unable to identify modular network structure in the connectome. Taken together, these results emphasize the heterogeneous efficacy of existing methods, and suggest that different confound regression strategies may be appropriate in the context of specific scientific goals.

@article{Zhang2001,
abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image segmentation.},

@article{Lindquist2009,
abstract = {Most brain research to date have focused on studying the amplitude of evoked fMRI responses, though there has recently been an increased interest in measuring onset, peak latency and duration of the responses as well. A number of modeling procedures provide measures of the latency and duration of fMRI responses. In this work we compare several techniques that vary in their assumptions, model complexity, and interpretation. For each method, we introduce methods for estimating amplitude, peak latency, and duration and for performing inference in a multi-subject fMRI setting. We then assess the techniques' relative sensitivity and their propensity for mis-attributing task effects on one parameter (e.g., duration) to another (e.g., amplitude). Finally, we introduce methods for quantifying model misspecification and assessing bias and power-loss related to the choice of model. Overall, the results show that it is surprisingly difficult to accurately recover true task-evoked changes in BOLD signal and that there are substantial differences among models in terms of power, bias and parameter confusability. Because virtually all fMRI studies in cognitive and affective neuroscience employ these models, the results bear on the interpretation of hemodynamic response estimates across a wide variety of psychological and neuroscientific studies.},

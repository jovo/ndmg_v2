\caption{\textbf{ndmg usage workflow}.
The \ndmg~pipeline enables accurate, reliable, robust, and usable analysis at the participant-, group-, and meganalysis levels.
Raw diffusion, functional and structural scans  are provided to the \ndmg participant-level analysis, which in turn outputs derivatives including connectomes at many different parcellation scales. 
By organizing the data according to the BIDS specification,  group-level analysis is automatically performed, and pooled across datasets for meganalysis.
%While participant-level analysis generates connectomes from diffusion MRI data, group-level analysis computes and plots a variety of graph statistics on the derived connectomes, both individually and as a group.
%The derivatives from all stages of \ndmg~are computed consistently and reliably across sessions and datasets, enabling the pooling of data for doing ``meganalysis.''.

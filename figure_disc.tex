\caption{\textbf{Prevalence of batch effects}. Discriminability was computed across the ten processed datasets using the dataset-id as the class label.
If no significant difference between datasets exists, the discriminability score
would not be significantly different from chance, a score of 0.363. Here, the discriminability score was 0.632, which
is significant with a p-value of less than 0.0001 when performing a permutation test, suggesting that there is
significant dataset specific signal in the graphs.}
% @gk: why is Templeton255 so different from the others?
